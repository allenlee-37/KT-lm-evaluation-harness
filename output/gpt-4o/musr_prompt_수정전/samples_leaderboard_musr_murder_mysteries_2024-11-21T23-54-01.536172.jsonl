A murder case at a bungee jumping site was definitely out of the ordinary. Today's victim was a young man named Mack, loud mouthed and cocky by all accounts. \n\nMack was bungee jumping the day he was killed. Oddly enough, according to the records, no one else was documented at the bungee jumping site that day, making this case even more peculiar. The first stop for the day was to visit one of Mack's housemates, a woman named Ana. They were seen leaving in the same vehicle from their shared housing complex the morning of the murder, and it was time for Winston to dig deeper. \n\nAs he pulled into the shared housing driveway, a nondescript car came into sight. He learned from neighbours that it was frequently used by multiple residents, but Ana had a peculiar interest in it. She would insist on driving whenever with a group of friends, later meticulously cleaning the car after each use. An idiosyncrasy of hers maybe, but a part of the puzzle nonetheless.\n\nWinston knocked on the door, Ana opened it warily, twiddling a cleaning cloth and spray in her hands and greeted him with a nervous nod. Ana gets nervous and fidgets with the cleaner and cloth when questioned. Winston could sense palpable unease as he started asking her questions.\n\n\"Ana, did you not join Mack and the others for bungee jumping today?\" Winston questioned, to which she responded, \"I signed up to jump. But I didn't end up going through with it.\"\n\n\"Any particular reason you didn't join the others, Ana?\" Winston proceeded. \n\nAna took a deep breath, \"Well sir, my faith doesn't really permit bungee jumping. Truth be told, I was persuaded strongly by Mack. I had even signed up out of peer pressure but couldn't push myself.\"\n\nIt was true – Mack was insisting that everyone in the group should bungee jump. Mack had reportedly also been vocal about ridiculing Ana’s faith, even encouraging others to join him in doing so. It was a significant factor in their relationship.\n\n\"Ana, did you and Mack leave in the same car for the bungee jumping event this morning?\" Winston gently pushed further.\n\n\"Yes. Yes, we did. We always carpool.\" She responded while anxiously using the cleaner and cloth on her car’s dashboard. Her eyes flickered nervously back to Winston, expecting the next question.\n\nWinston took a deep breath, standing up to leave, \"Alright Ana, that should cover everything for now. We'll be in touch.\"\n\nAna nervously nodded without looking up from her cleaning, wringing the cloth repeatedly as Winston walked away, left again with another piece to the enigmatic puzzle of Mack's murder.\n\nThe day was getting older and Winston was getting more tired, but the case was fresh, and he wasn't one to back down. He tugged on his coat as he approached the bashful teen waiting for him by the police station.\n\n\"Mackenzie, it is?\" he asked, extending his hand.\n\n\"Yeah, that's right.\" The slight lisp, overlaid with blanket anxiety, confirmed what the school reports suggested.\n\n\"You were at the site when Mack... erm... you know,\" Winston's voice was methodical, calm -- almost robotic. The suspicion on Mackenzie was not unfounded - the security cameras showed him buying nunchaku a week before. \n\nMackenzie shifted on his feet, looking away before answering, \"Yeah, I was there.\"\n\nWinston pulled out a small notebook, \"What were you doing there, Mackenzie?”\n\n“Bungee jumping, like Mack… Then I left. I didn't... I didn't do anything…” Mackenzie replied.\n\nInternally, Winston sighed at the never-ending waterfall of teenage angst this case was turning into. \n\n“Martial arts, huh?” Winston segued, gesturing to a bruise on Mackenzie’s knuckles. “Nunchaku particularly, I see? Training does include the use of those, correct?” \n\nThe change in Mackenzie’s demeanor mirrored the bitterness in the last month’s weather – dark eyes replaced with ice-cold ones. “Yeah,” he admitted, shrinking slightly.\n\nMackenzie always took pride in being the best at everything. So when Mack got everything he wanted - the promotion to team captain, the respect, the attention - it was a hard pill for Mackenzie to swallow. Winston remembered the team talk, Mackenzie was indeed the top candidate but it had gone to Mack instead. \n\nWhat clinched it was Mackenzie’s remarks about Mack, echoing whispers of dispute and bickering, lost in the crowded lunchroom. There were also multiple witness reports of the two seen arguing at the bungee jumping site previously. Mackenzie had indeed said disparaging, almost emotional things about Mack – all stemming from a potent brew of jealousy, Winston inferred.\n\nShifting later through the detritus of Mackenzie's life, Winston discovered the nunchaku that matched the forensics report.

He observed Mackenzie through his binoculars, watching closely as they hastily unlocked their front door. It had been a long day at the office for Mackenzie and, like clockwork, they were seen taking their customary break on a public bench, working on their laptop.\n\nBefore long, Mackenzie was seen through the partially closed blinds of their apartment, sitting at their desk with their laptop open. They had just returned from a local cyber security meetup, a reality Winston discovered after following Mackenzie to the event later that evening. As Winston watched, they shifted their body and their eyes darted around, Winston duly noted on Mackenzie's apparent concern for online privacy.\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston thought, while making a mental note to do some research on further cyber security meetups occurring in the vicinity.\n\nThe next morning, Winston watched Mackenzie walk out of a martial arts training center. As Mackenzie stopped to say goodbye to their instructor, Winston quickly snapped a photo on his phone. In the picture, Winston could clearly see Mackenzie practicing techniques with the unmistakable form of Mackenzie's sturdy nunchaku resting in the backdrop. This gave Winston a clue that his martial arts training includes nunchaku techniques.\n\nWinston's interest peaked further when he followed Mackenzie to a local shop where they were seen purchasing a new set of nunchaku. Even more intriguing was when they examined a pair of cufflinks on display with a yearning look, cufflinks Winston knew were identical to a pair Mack frequently flaunted around. It appeared Mack had things that Mackenzie also desired.\n\nThe investigator decided it was time to pay Mackenzie a visit. He knocked on the apartment door and Mackenzie cautiously invited him in.\n\nPleasantries were briefly exchanged before Winston's gaze quickly fell on the laptop that was resting by some papers next to an open window.\n\n\"You always take this with you to work?\" Winston inquired, pointing at the laptop.\n\n\"Every day,\" Mackenzie replied, \"I can't leave my work at the office.\"\n\n\"Work goes that well, huh?\" Winston probed further. \"I hear you were recently ... overlooked for a promotion.\"\n\nAt these words, Mackenzie's expression darkened. \"I was the top candidate, you know. It should've been mine. Mack, the new guy, he is nothing compared to me, but he takes it. That promotion, the respect I had. Even those cufflinks I have always wanted, somehow Mack always gets to have them.\"\n\nWinston nodded, making a mental note of Mackenzie's reaction. They turned the conversation to martial arts and during the chat, Mackenzie unintentionally revealed their prowess with nunchaku.\n\nIn a small, hidden compartment in Mackenzie's wardrobe, Winston found the pair of nunchaku that Mackenzie had recently purchased. He swiftly snapped a picture of this evidence before closing the wardrobe.\n\nAs the day grew late, Winston thanked Mackenzie for their time and headed out, feeling more certain than ever about the path his investigation was following.\n\nWinston sat in his office, photos of Mack --the bungee jumper found dead-- scattered heartbreakingly across his desk. The lack of clues at the murder site puzzled him, nothing seemed out of place. All he had was an unusual weapon, the nunchaku, not something he’d found at too many crime scenes.\n\nStanding up, he straightened his tie and headed to the shared housing complex of the victim and suspect. Ana Diaz lived here, along with Mack. Ground rules for questioning the suspect were laid out in his mind.\n\nAna received him with a stoic expression and invited him inside. Her suitcase was unpacked, strewn helter-skelter around the room. She explained she had come back from the bungee jumping site late last night, still in shock about Mack’s murder.\n\nNunchaku lay on the table.

{"doc_id": 2, "doc": {"narrative": "In the haze of neon lights and the serving of a silent hand of fate, Timothy lies dead in a casino, a sai his cruel end, leaving the unruffled Detective Winston to interrogate suspects, Harry and Rosemary.\n\nIt had been a long day for Winston. The air was heavy with the scent of fresh coffee and the clamour of a bustling restaurant kitchen. His eyes fell on a seasoned chef, Rosemary, as she deftly wielded her bladed tools — knives, cleavers, graters — with calm precision. Watching her, it came as no surprise that Rosemary had clocked several years in this industry.\n\nSomething in the room changed. Shouting ensued, then a loud crash that rang out above the normal kitchen discord. Rosemary had hurled a metal pot across the room. The assistant, who stood close by, looked shocked but unharmed. Winston decided it was his cue to intervene.\n\n\"Rosemary, care to explain what just happened?\" Winston asked, stepping closer to the irate chef.\n\nShe gave him a guarded look before deliberately changing the subject, \"Did you know Timothy was a fan of my stir fry? Ironic, isn't it?\"\n\nWinston frowned slightly at the statement but decided to push forward. He knew how to dance around subjects, but Rosemary seemed skilled at the bucolic ballet of the restaurant business.\n\n\"I've heard some disturbing claims, Rosemary,\" Winston brought out his notebook, \"about the threats you've been issuing to Timothy, and your hostility towards people of his nationality.\"\n\nAt Winston's words, Rosemary ran a weary hand over her face and sighed. \"Seems word gets around.\"\n\n\"A public event, not long ago. You spoke openly about your, um-\" Winston glanced down at his notes, \"-'distaste' for Chinese folks,\" he pressed on, \"and you've been caught on tape making similar remarks towards Timothy.\"\n\n\"Is that a crime, detective?\" Rosemary challenged.\n\n\"I'm just here to piece the puzzle together. I understand you take a particular interest in Asian culture - antique Asian weapons in particular. I've seen your collection, Rosemary. Sais, even?\" he prodded, hoping for a reaction.\n\nRosemary's gaze sharpened as she turned her back on him, busily cleaning her array of kitchen knives. She didn't confirm nor deny his observation. Noting her silence, Winston thanked her for her time and walked out onto the casino floor, a maelstrom of thoughts whirling around his mind. He felt like he was leaving with more questions than when he had entered.\n\nWinston took a good look at the crime scene, a corner of the bustling casino, cordoned off by the police tape. Something felt grimly out of place among the bright lights and incessant chatter of the casino. He carefully sifted through the conflicting information and people's statements spinning in his head.\n\nTime to get some answers, Winston thought, and made his way to his interviewee.\n\nIt was late in the day when he finally knocked on Harry's door. A man in his early thirties, with a life-hardened face glanced out at him skeptically.\n\n\"Harry, correct?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"And who's asking?\" came the guarded reply.\n\n\"Detective Winston,\" he flashed his badge, \"I'm here to ask you a few questions about Timothy.\"\n\nHarry's eyes flashed, \"I'm not surprised,\" he grumbled. \"Come on in then.\"\n\nAs Winston made his way inside, he noticed the place bore a striking resemblance to traditional dojo settings. A pair of sai swords caught his eye, arranged carefully on a display holder. A typical weapon of the martial arts form Harry used to instruct.\n\n\"Nice collection.\" Winston gestured towards the sai. \"You instruct?\"\n\nHarry looked back at the sai, \"Used to.\"\n\nHarry's manner was gruff, but he seemed at home sharing his old days as a martial arts instructor. They talked about martial arts, how Harry won several competitions, his daily training routine, which apparently included practicing with the sai regularly. Harry's days as a horse trainer surfaced later in the conversation.\n\n\"Got dealt a bad hand?\" Winston inquired casually, nodding at the pile of losing horse race betting slips on Harry's coffee table. \n\nHarry grunted, \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWinston knew Harry only had income from betting on races, and recently he had lost quite a few. Harry had a deep gambling debt with Timothy over his betting habits. Photography was not Winston's hobby, but he recalled Harry's face distinctly in the casino cameras' footage from before the murder took place. There were rumors that Timothy was planning to expose Harry's debt to the other horse owners, and the situation got tough.\n\n\"Got into any recent arguments?\" Winston asked.\n\nHarry frowned and averted his eyes, \"Maybe...just one with Timothy at the casino.”\n\nWinston nodded, keeping his expression neutral. The timing was unfortunate, he thought. And that debt wasn't going anywhere, especially with Harry having recently lost his job at the stables.\n\n\"Heard you were giving out loans?' Winston asked.\n\nHarry's face stiffened, \"He needed money\", he replied, explaining that Timothy had lent him a large sum of money specifically for his betting habit, a haunted expression crossing his face.\n\nWinston stood up, concluding his visit, \"Just one last thing, Harry,\" Winston queried, \"The VIP lounge, in the casino? You're familiar with it, aren't you?\"\n\nHarry met Winston's gaze, resignation in his eyes, \"Used to spend a lot of time there.\"\n\nAs Winston exited the apartment, he couldn't shake off the heavy feeling hanging in the air, leaving him with more questions than answers.

You spoke openly about your, um-\\\" Winston glanced down at his notes, \\\"-'distaste' for Chinese folks,\\\" he pressed on, \\\"and you've been caught on tape making similar remarks towards Timothy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is that a crime, detective?\\\" Rosemary challenged.\\n\\n\\\"I'm just here to piece the puzzle together. I understand you take a particular interest in Asian culture - antique Asian weapons in particular. I've seen your collection, Rosemary. Sais, even?\\\" he prodded, hoping for a reaction.\\n\\nRosemary's gaze sharpened as she turned her back on him, busily cleaning her array of kitchen knives. She didn't confirm nor deny his observation. Noting her silence, Winston thanked her for her time and walked out onto the casino floor, a maelstrom of thoughts whirling around his mind. He felt like he was leaving with more questions than when he had entered.\\n\\nWinston took a good look at the crime scene, a corner of the bustling casino, cordoned off by the police tape. Something felt grimly out of place among the bright lights and incessant chatter of the casino. He carefully sifted through the conflicting information and people's statements spinning in his head.\\n\\nTime to get some answers, Winston thought, and made his way to his interviewee.\\n\\nIt was late in the day when he finally knocked on Harry's door. A man in his early thirties, with a life-hardened face glanced out at him skeptically.\\n\\n\\\"Harry, correct?\\\" Winston asked.\\n\\n\\\"And who's asking?\\\" came the guarded reply.\\n\\n\\\"Detective Winston,\\\" he flashed his badge, \\\"I'm here to ask you a few questions about Timothy.\\\"\\n\\nHarry's eyes flashed, \\\"I'm not surprised,\\\" he grumbled. \\\"Come on in then.\\\"\\n\\nAs Winston made his way inside, he noticed the place bore a striking resemblance to traditional dojo settings. A pair of sai swords caught his eye, arranged carefully on a display holder. A typical weapon of the martial arts form Harry used to instruct.\\n\\n\\\"Nice collection.\\\" Winston gestured towards the sai. \\\"You instruct?\\\"\\n\\nHarry looked back at the sai, \\\"Used to.\\\"\\n\\nHarry's manner was gruff, but he seemed at home sharing his old days as a martial arts instructor. They talked about martial arts, how Harry won several competitions, his daily training routine, which apparently included practicing with the sai regularly. Harry's days as a horse trainer surfaced later in the conversation.\\n\\n\\\"Got dealt a bad hand?\\\" Winston inquired casually, nodding at the pile of losing horse race betting slips on Harry's coffee table. \\n\\nHarry grunted, \\\"Yeah, you could say that.\\\"\\n\\nWinston knew Harry only had income from betting on races, and recently he had lost quite a few. Harry had a deep gambling debt with Timothy over his betting habits. Photography was not Winston's hobby, but he recalled Harry's face distinctly in the casino cameras' footage from before the murder took place. There were rumors that Timothy was planning to expose Harry's debt to the other horse owners, and the situation got tough.\\n\\n\\\"Got into any recent arguments?\\\" Winston asked.\\n\\nHarry frowned and averted his eyes, \\\"Maybe...just one with Timothy at the casino.\\u201d\\n\\nWinston nodded, keeping his expression neutral. The timing was unfortunate, he thought. And that debt wasn't going anywhere, especially with Harry having recently lost his job at the stables.\\n\\n\\\"Heard you were giving out loans?' Winston asked.\\n\\nHarry's face stiffened, \\\"He needed money\\\", he replied, explaining that Timothy had lent him a large sum of money specifically for his betting habit, a haunted expression crossing his face.\\n\\nWinston stood up, concluding his visit, \\\"Just one last thing, Harry,\\\" Winston queried, \\\"The VIP lounge, in the casino? You're familiar with it, aren't you?\\\"\\n\\nHarry met Winston's gaze, resignation in his eyes, \\\"Used to spend a lot of time there.\\\"\\n\\nAs Winston exited the apartment, he couldn't shake off the heavy feeling hanging in the air, leaving him with more questions than answers.

His keen eye caught sight of the security camera footage playing at the front desk – it clearly showed Harry walking into the casino just moments before the tragic murder occurred. He wove his way quickly through the crowd towards his destination – the inner edge of the casino. This secluded corner, often frequented by high rollers, was a crime scene tonight, cordoned off with police tape. Harry, a well-established horse trainer, knew this particular corner all too well.\n\nWinston found Harry standing at the periphery of the scene, alone, seemingly lost in thought. A few onlookers nearby whispered about a heated argument they had witnessed between Harry and Timothy earlier in the night in this very corner.\n\n\"Harry,\" the detective started, as the recognized face turned to meet him, \"Been a while since you've stepped foot in a martial arts tournament, eh?\"\n\nHarry grunted. He wasn't surprised. After all, he was a well-decorated martial arts champion, with several competition victories under his belt. \"In another life, maybe,\" he grumbled. \n\nLiving in the busy business district full of martial arts schools including his own, he had once been a revered martial arts instructor, imparting his knowledge of a specific style – one where the sai was a commonly used weapon – to his students. Daily practice with a sai was part of his routine for years. \n\n\"I heard about your argument with Timothy tonight,\" Winston continued, \"Right here in the corner where our poor victim was found, Harry.\" He gestured towards the cordoned area, then back at Harry. The horse trainer stiffened slightly, but nodded all the same as the reality of questioning sank in. \"I was spotted in the footage, wasn't I?\" he muttered, the deep-seated gambling debt he owed Timothy sketched visible worry lines on his face.\n\n\"As part of our ongoing investigations, we've been checking the security camera footage from the casino,\" Winston explained. \"Interestingly, you're seen entering the place just before the murder.\"\n\nOverhearing their conversation, a staff member chuckled softly before adding, \"He walked in and called John at the front desk, introducing himself as 'Bill'. Then shortly after, he asked Sara, our bartender for a drink, mentioning his name was 'Tom'.

He shrugged and gave them a knowing smile, reminding Winston of the gamble-loving spirit he was dealing with — a spirit that left its fingerprints all over the casino's registration documents. \n\nAs Winston walked away from Harry, he pondered on the debt, the aliases, the martial arts background, and the turning wheel of possibilities in his investigation. Indeed, it was going to be a long night at the casino.\n\nWinston rubbed his temples, grappling with the intricacies of this mystifying case. The victim was Timothy, a man of Chinese heritage, which made the crime scene, a luxurious casino, all the more odd. The murder weapon had been identified as a sai, an exotic Asian weapon.

A visit to the zoo was calming therapy for her bed-ridden brother... at least it usually.\n\nWinston could still envision the terrible scene at the zoo where Daniel had been found lifeless, an eerie death brought on by a medical syringe. Nothing in the vicinity suggested the presence of a murderer except for a couple of eyewitnesses who had spotted Emma around the same time as the murder.\n\nHis last stop was the hospital, where he bumped into Emma finishing her shift. Daniel had been under her care at this very facility. It was clear to Winston that the system trusted her and she held sway in her workplace. \n\nWinston had more questions but he left them for another day. The facts had certainly pointed him to interesting possibilities that had to be pursued diligently. It was a murder that he could sense ran deeper than it appeared.\n\nWinston gingerly stepped into the blurry morning light. His first port of call, the infamous Zoo where Daniel's life was abruptly cut short. As he made his way past the monkey enclosure, a bright red hat peeked out from a treetop. Daniel's hat. No doubt he had been here, but what was he doing in the primate area?\n\nWinston took a step back and scanned the area. His gaze fell upon the makeshift wooden bar tucked away by the corner. That's when he noticed Amelia setting up her bar, placing various liquor bottles in their places, stacking the glasses precisely in her own thirsty manner. Amelia, the bartender from the watering hole Daniel frequented, had begun her day at the zoo early that morning. \n\nSuddenly, the memory of the previous night flashed before Winston's eyes. He remembered seeing Daniel, chatty and jovial as ever at Amelia's bar. This was before the incident, before the silence surrounded by chaos. \n\nWith determined steps, Winston hurried over to Amelia's regular bar in the city. As he walked in, he observed the familiar locale. The cracks in the wall, the faded posters. The painting hanging on the wall of Amelia's home was exactly the same. A violent brawl depicted in the same bar, reflecting Amelia's artistic license in her paintings. A perfect replica of the bar, complete with each minute crack in the wall was stroked with such precision that it sent a shiver down his spine. Amelia, an artist by morning, illustrating the violence that would occur by night.\n\nAll of a sudden, a piercing screech emanated from a nearby enclosure. Winston, startled, quickly turned around and realized it was lunchtime at the zoo. Staff were feeding the animals. Among the staff was Amelia, wielding a small syringe, proficiently sedating an agitated monkey. Winston drew a sharp breath, recalling her proficiency with syringes, the odd weapon of choice in Daniel's murder.\n\nAmelia noticed the detective at nearly the same instant and walked over. Her spunky red hair tied back into a ponytail, her bright green eyes challenging him. Amelia wasn't your typical bartender.  \n\"Brings you quite early today, Winston? Can I get you something to drink?\" Amelia smirked, avoiding any informative conversation. \n\n\"Was Daniel here yesterday?\" Winston probed, ignoring her question. \n\n\"Sure, he got in around the afternoon.\" Amelia paused, glancing at the post-midday sun. \"Anything else you want to?\",\nWinston decided to dig a bit more, \"What time did you close last night, Amelia? Any company?\"\n\n\"Late, as always. I'm alone after hours, you know.\" Amelia shrugged carelessly as she took a small canvas out from behind the bar counter, ready to continue her post-work painting ritual.\n\nAmelia, the artist who moonlighted as a bartender, and a skillful one at that. Winston thought to himself. She defensively guarded her solitary space, applying her painting skills onto canvas after hours, but one whose depictions were less than tranquil.\n\nWith his visit done, Winston tipped his hat off to Amelia and moved on for the day, leaving a nervous bartender in her wake.", "question": "Who is the most likely murderer?", "choices": "['Amelia', 'Emma']", "answer_index": 1, "answer_choice": "Emma"}, "target": "(a)", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": ["[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please answer the following question with (a), (b), (c), (d) \\n\\nIn the quiet chaos of the city zoo, Detective Winston finds himself investigating an unusual murder, where Daniel, a zookeeper, was fatally injected by a syringe, with only two suspects in sight: Amelia, the grieving widow, and Emma, the secretive co-worker.\\n\\nWinston sat in his chair, sifting through files, his fingertips glossing over the surface of several medical badges.

Serenity, the star wrestler, had publicly threatened her opponent, Terrance. And Terrance, poor lad, was found pale and trembling after their match. Terrance was no stranger to the grit and physicality of ranch life, but the wrestling ring was another story entirely. He had been in the losing end of a previous matchup with Serenity. \n\nFinally placated by the caffeine and recalling his purpose, Winston trudged to the boots and scruff leather of the local ranch. He was greeted by the sight of Terrance coordinating his ranch work, his sun-worn skin a testament to long hours under the warm Texan sun. \"You're Terrance I suppose?\" Winston asked, as he gestured to the flourishing land around them.\n\n\"That'd be me, Detective,\" Terrance replied in a thick southern drawl. \"This land's been around longer than I have. Been a rancher all my life.\"\n\nThere was an odd sense of hitched anxiety when Winston brought up the chainsaw classes he'd heard Terrance attended. \"Gotta know how to operatin' it,\" Terrance replied. \"Helps keepin' the place run smooth.\"\n\nWinston hustled over to where the recent wrestling match had taken place. It was a local tradition in the town and Terrance was no stranger to it, being a regular sponsor. It was a sweltering evening when he found himself at the scene, their wrestling ring splattered with the remnants of what occurred.\n\nReturning to the station under the glow of disjointed neon lights, Winston on a hunch asked a few local attendees about the particular wrestling match where Serenity was killed. Terrance was in the crowd that night, cheering heatedly during the match.\n\nIn a more relaxed visit to the local bar, Terrance appeared more forthright. \"She was strong, Detective. Really strong,\" Terrance eased into his confession after a few sips of his drink. At another instance, in a low murmured admission to some friends, Terrance had been heard saying he felt threatened by Serenity. There were rumors around of Terrance being seen frequently repairing a chainsaw. The very same chainsaw Terrance learned to operate, and the chilling instrument that ended Serenity's life.\n\nFor now, this was the puzzle Winston had to unravel. He gave Terrance a long, discerning look over the rim of his beer glass before leaving the lightly crowded bar. On his way out, the words of a recent reports echoed in his head, “A chainsaw is essential in ranch work…”\n\nWinston had been downing cups of coffee all day, trying to make sense of the pieces of what seemed like a nonsensical puzzle. He made a decision to visit the place it all transpired – an old, grimy wrestling ring where Serenity had met her horrific end.\n\nThe image of the chainsaw used as the murder weapon kept coming back to him. So brutal was it that Winston found it hard to shake off. He had heard that Nelson, the painter and prime suspect in the case, had been seen training with a chainsaw - a tool that he directly employed in his painting procedures, forming part of his job. The oddity seemed to strengthen the potential motive Nelson had for this grim act and Winston felt compelled to pursue this lead.\n\nAfter a quick tour to the local gallery, Winston visited an exhibition where Nelson's pieces were showcased. It was evident that his chainsaw artwork had amassed some level of local attention, owing to their exceptional detailing accomplished with a chainsaw. Nelson adored wood, especially intricate shapes created out of it. He would often proclaim that shaping wood using his chainsaw was an integral part of his painting role. His proficiency seemed uncanny, almost eerie, but the public admired his work for its notable woodsiness.\n\nFrom the gallery, Winston travelled to the correction facility where Nelson used to work. The officers seemed reluctant to speak about the past events which led to Nelson's termination and the painter's complete obliteration from the collective memory. Winston found no records of Nelson in the personnel files. His data seemed to have been deliberately wiped out, prompting Winston to question their collective avoidance in discussing Nelson.\n\nWinston then moved to his final stop, Nelson's quaint bungalow. Unusually quiet and still with the curtains tightly drawn; not the usual sight, as reported by neighbors who mentioned Nelson's affection for painting under natural light. Winston learned that Nelson had ceased attending the weekly game nights at the local pub, coinciding with his new preference for drawn curtains.\n\nAs Winston introspected leaning against his car, he realized the significance of the patterns in the changing behaviors of the painter. Winston was now confident that Nelson indeed had a strong motive in Serenity's demise – albeit, this was supported by an eerie amalgamation of evidence: the drawn curtains, the nonattendance at the pub, the wiped data, the unusual termination, and finally, his habitual, ominous use of chainsaws. \n\nTime was ticking away, and Winston was now more determined than ever. He drove away from Nelson’s bungalow, deep in thoughts about the painter and his last works that haunted his thoughts.

Not everyone can do that.\"\n\nThe detective couldn't help but notice Unity's slight smirk. \"I can imagine,\" Winston replied casually. \"This kind of specialized training demands skill, doesn’t it?\"\n\nUnity chuckled at that. \"Indeed, it does...\"\n\n“The roller rink, it’s not too far from here, is it?” Detective Winston asked, pointing down the street.\n\n\"No, just a short walk. It's practically on the same street as us,\" Unity confirmed, her tone cautious now. \"I was there earlier today, right after completing my last tour and just before the dreadful incident happened. I didn't notice anything unusual.\"\n\nDetective Winston gave her a non-committal nod, his attention now elsewhere as he studied a photo held at an angle, the light catching a face he knew too well. \"Ah, Clarence?” Unity's frozen nod and dead stare confirmed his suspicion. The victim had been convinced Unity was a fraud, publicly threatening to expose the loopholes in her supposedly comprehensive knowledge on maritime history just before his untimely murder.\n\nUnity was proud, her reputation meant everything to her.\n\nWinston's eyes returned to Unity, her face pale under the museum's poor lighting. He had nothing concrete that could tie Unity to the murder, but the pieces were falling into place.\n\n“Well, Unity, thank you for your time,” Winston concluded as he left the museum, leaving Unity alone among the ancient displays and echoing silence.\n\nWinston was sitting down in a neon-lit roller rink, his tired eyes soaking in the scene of Clarence's unusual murder. No leads except for one: Vivian, a vendor who worked in the rink. He'd heard rumors about her past, her fascination with historical warfare, and her penchant for sprinkling violent movie quotes during conversations. \n\nHe had heard from the other vendors in the roller rink, how they found her behavior disconcerting, especially during meetings when she'd regale them with dialogues from brutal, blood-soaked films. Not just that, she was known to have an unnerving love for these violent movies, a fact confirmed by countless customers who recounted their conversations with her. \n\nWinston knew Vivian had a sister. A sister who once confided in her about Clarence's inappropriate messages. Vivian, with her history of being fiercely protective of her sister – once even taking on a bully who bothered the little girl - perceived Clarence's behavior as a threat.\n\nWith all this knowledge, Winston decided he should go and meet up with Vivian. It wasn't a short ride; he had to traverse the half-lit, mostly deserted city. But, it was necessary.\n\nAs he knocked on Vivian's front door, anxiety crept over him. He didn't know what to expect.\n\n\"Hello, Detective,\" Vivian greeted him after opening the door. Her house was filled with vintage items, among which was a trident, an artifact Winston couldn't help but notice. \"Yes, I'm a bit of a relic collector myself,\" Vivian confessed.\n\nThey talked about her job at the rink, her colleagues, and much to Winston's astonishment, she even mentioned attending a trident handling course last summer. Vivian's passionate recall of her past as a historian specializing in ancient warfare left a lasting impression. \n\nThe conversation shifted to more personal matters. As Winston learned more about her family, Vivian confirmed that her sister was indeed her last living relative. She recounted about how she defended her sister against bullies in the past and how she was in an uncomfortable position due to Clarence's intrusive behavior.\n\nWinston asked, \"Clarence used to come around a lot, didn't he?\" Vivian's face turned stiff, \"Yes, he did. Always with the same routine. Always bothering my sister non-stop.\"\n\n\"Well, someone poisoned the well, didn't they?\" Vivian quoted, sounding like a character from one of her favorite films. Winston left her in silence, leaving her own words as a cryptic closure. \n\nAs he exited, Winston felt a shiver run down his spine. Exiting the lonesome house and her world of historical artifacts and violent movie quotes, he couldn't shake off the eeriness of Vivian’s world. \n\nFinally, Winston drove off, leaving Vivian's historical artifact-filled refuge behind, the chilling quotes from violent movies reverberating in his ears.", "question": "Who is the most likely murderer?", "choices": "['Unity', 'Vivian']", "answer_index": 0, "answer_choice": "Unity"}, "target": "(`)", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": ["[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please answer the following question with (a), (b), (c), (d) \\n\\nIn the eerie silence of a roller rink, a man named Clarence met his startling end by a trident, pulling Detective Winston into a web of enmity and suspicion involving two unusual suspects, Unity and Vivian.\\n\\n\\\"What brings you here, detective?\\\" Unity stood up from the front desk of the maritime museum, the cold light accentuating her already pale complexion.\\n\\n\\\"I hope you haven't come to see the tridents, the tour just ended,\\\" she said, holding up a ring of keys that jingled delicately. \\\"As the tour guide here, I'm the only one with keys to the exhibits and I\\u2019ve had quite the training in handling and explaining these tridents.\\\"\\n\\nDetective Winston nodded casually, taking in the details of Unity's surroundings. \\\"Interesting set of keys you got there.

Vivian, with her history of being fiercely protective of her sister \\u2013 once even taking on a bully who bothered the little girl - perceived Clarence's behavior as a threat.\\n\\nWith all this knowledge, Winston decided he should go and meet up with Vivian. It wasn't a short ride; he had to traverse the half-lit, mostly deserted city. But, it was necessary.\\n\\nAs he knocked on Vivian's front door, anxiety crept over him. He didn't know what to expect.\\n\\n\\\"Hello, Detective,\\\" Vivian greeted him after opening the door. Her house was filled with vintage items, among which was a trident, an artifact Winston couldn't help but notice. \\\"Yes, I'm a bit of a relic collector myself,\\\" Vivian confessed.\\n\\nThey talked about her job at the rink, her colleagues, and much to Winston's astonishment, she even mentioned attending a trident handling course last summer. Vivian's passionate recall of her past as a historian specializing in ancient warfare left a lasting impression. \\n\\nThe conversation shifted to more personal matters. As Winston learned more about her family, Vivian confirmed that her sister was indeed her last living relative. She recounted about how she defended her sister against bullies in the past and how she was in an uncomfortable position due to Clarence's intrusive behavior.\\n\\nWinston asked, \\\"Clarence used to come around a lot, didn't he?\\\" Vivian's face turned stiff, \\\"Yes, he did. Always with the same routine. Always bothering my sister non-stop.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, someone poisoned the well, didn't they?\\\" Vivian quoted, sounding like a character from one of her favorite films. Winston left her in silence, leaving her own words as a cryptic closure. \\n\\nAs he exited, Winston felt a shiver run down his spine. Exiting the lonesome house and her world of historical artifacts and violent movie quotes, he couldn't shake off the eeriness of Vivian\\u2019s world. \\n\\nFinally, Winston drove off, leaving Vivian's historical artifact-filled refuge behind, the chilling quotes from violent movies reverberating in his ears.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Unity\\n(b) - Vivian\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(b) - Vivian"]], "filtered_resps": ["(b)"], "doc_hash": "f29222fd76e6e644ce0db8d6e70ac8513a6f893032f4716bdbebb0fc1e5d3802", "prompt_hash": "1927e496599685031e49d970b542ceded3747febb1c63b6071409a71b30e34ab", "target_hash": "e300f251dc09073a9781733cd99758d04a98290157b77fb5c4a986b123900fc6", "exact_match": 0.0}
{"doc_id": 11, "doc": {"narrative": "In the eerie silence of a roller rink, a man named Clarence met his startling end by a trident, pulling Detective Winston into a web of enmity and suspicion involving two unusual suspects, Unity and Vivian.\n\nThe flashing lights of the roller rink danced in a kaleidoscope of colors across Winston's stern face. He always had a knack for ending up in the most bizarre crime scenes, and this one was no different: A man named Clarence ended up dead at a roller rink, and the murder weapon was a trident. His primary suspect was Unity, the tour guide who Clarence had recently discovered was faking her knowledge about maritime history and planning to expose her. \n\nGathering himself, he strolled over to the corner, introducing himself to Unity, who was currently explaining to a group of tourists about the different types of tridents on display, her gaze fixated on the cases or wandering the distance, never meeting the eyes of her audience. She had the keys to the exhibits and thus unrestricted access to the tridents, a detail unbeknownst to the onlookers but not to Winston. \n\n\"I understand you’re in charge of this trident exhibit.” Winston pointed to the display case behind her. Unity glanced at the detective, showing a twinkling keychain, nodding. \"Yes, sir. I am the keeper of the keys around here,\" she confirmed, outwardly displaying a pride in her role.\n\nWinston started to probe: \"How did you end up in this line of work? You seem young...\" Unity took a moment, her gaze dropping to the ground. \"You could say it was my destiny,\" She replied, \"I've always been fascinated with the here, pretending to grasp every bit of maritime history...or at least pretending to do so…”\n\nPrintfessed, Winston furthered his inquiry. “So, you have exclusive access to these tridents, right?” He meditated her reactions. Unity took a moment, her gaze deflecting to the ground and then at the tourists’ faces. Faking her blithe demeanor, she corroborated, “Indeed, I do. These tridents we have here are from various eras—each belonging to a significant point in history and I am trained to handle them with utmost care. As a tour guide, I am responsible for explaining the heritage and significance of these artifacts.. \"\n\nUnity abruptly steered the conversation towards the artefacts and their historical context, evading Winston's direct questions. To an untrained eye, this would've made her look like an industrious professional. But Winston noticed her tactical evasion, making him ponder over how Clarence had noticed the same. He remembered how Clarence had confessed about Unity's deception before his untimely demise, her feigned knowledge about maritime history, her meticulously concealed secret, her meticulously fabricated response. \n\nWinston decided to step back for a bit, reassess his facts and clues. He had a gut feeling that both Clarence's death and Unity's secret were intertwined that this tour wasn't as benign as it seemed. He knew he was onto something. Unity's pride, her faked knowledge, her training with tridents, her constant evasion... While they weren't direct evidence, they were leading him somewhere.\n\nWith hands in his coat pockets, Winston retreated, mind abuzz with the next steps he needed to take in this intriguing roller rink homicide case. All the while under the riotous strobe lights, Unity's voice continued to echo through the space, meticulously detailing the care for tridents, her twisted pride in her position unfaltering. Even as they stood over a murder scene, she maintained the charade, pretending as if nothing had ever happened.\n\nDetective Winston scanned over the vivid crime scene for a moment, the macabre tableau horribly out of place in the otherwise cheery atmosphere of a roller rink. Luminescent skates scattered haphazardly over the checkered floors, their normally playful glow eerily reflecting off pools of crimson. His mind slowly pieced together the events that led up to this, putting a face to the victim - Clarence, a man known for spending his every Wednesday nights weaving his way around this very rink on roller skates, his love for the sport unparalleled.\n\nWith a heavy breath, he set towards his first line of inquiry: Vivian, a woman with an affinity to ancient warfare, the campus vendor, who was known more for her expertise in old military tactics than her concessions. He found her behind a small food counter, her arms steady as she meticulously arranged pretzels on a tray.\n\n\"Evening, Vivian,\" he greeted, his tone conspicuously casual.\n\n\"Detective,\" she nodded, not pausing her work. It was clear she respected the gravity the situation held; she just was not going to show it in the middle of her shift.\n\n\"I understand you have an impressive collection of historical artifacts, some of which include ancient weaponry?\" Winston broached the subject delicately.\n\n\"Yes,\" she conceded, keeping her gaze lowered. \"One of the weapons being a trident, if I recall correctly.\"\n\nVivian froze momentarily, to draw breath or collect her thoughts, he couldn't discern. \"Yes, that's correct. I even attended some trident handling courses last summer, part of an educational experience,\" she clarified, her tone suddenly defensive.\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston said breezily, not wanting to sharpen the conversation's edge any further. \"Tell me, Vivian. Is it also true that your sister is your only living relative, and you've had to step in to protect her on a few occasions? Like, when a school bully once tormented her?”\n\nSurprised, Vivian admitted. \"Yes, Detective. My sister means everything to me. I stopped that bully, and I would do anything to keep her safe.\"\n\nFeeling he was making progress, Winston casually unveiled his most delicate inquiry yet, \"By the way, your sister stopped by earlier.\"\n\nVivian's back stiffened, a spark of alertness crossing her face. \"She did?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Winston replied, trying to suppress any hint of curiosity. \"She mentioned she’d spoken to you about Clarence sending her some inappropriate messages? She said it had particularly upset her, knowing how dedicated Clarence is to his Wednesday night skating sessions.\"\n\nFor a moment, Vivian looked cornered, before a veil of resignation fell over her face, \"Yes, Detective.

Nothing out of the ordinary. Her classmates know her to be systematic, picking up the pace at which she had been twirling the nunchaku around; she had been at this for a while. Today's training session ended with each student placing their nunchaku back in its storage area. Emma, being one of the last attendees to leave, noticed that the instructor was already preoccupied with another task and wasn't paying attention. This allowed Emma to slyly pocket her training Nunchaku, unnoticed by everyone. Emma usually attended these classes regularly, blending easily within her group, never causing a fuss.\n\nEmma's next stop was Stella's. Winston examined Emma's calendar and noted that she and Stella had an appointment back at Stella's home for a fitting. Stella liked having her fittings at home, right there in the kitchen. Their appointment was routine; the kitchen was the best spot for Stella to have a fitting given its large, airy space.

She knew her studio was a secure private space, no prying eyes to worry about. But then, something piqued Stella's interest. She found a hidden stack of papers from Emma's sketchbook. Intrigued, Stella began looking more closely at the sketches. They were designs of a new collection, never before seen. And as she scrutinized them, a glassy look came over Stella's eyes. These designs resembled her own unlaunched collection, she realized.\n\nEmma had arrived back at the studio to find Stella stiff with anger and an odd collection of sketch pages in her hand. Stella looked up at Emma, her features hardening as she accused her of plagiarism and threatened to expose her.\n\nDespite Emma's flair for art and design, this niche of Stella's discovery in her studio led Winston back to the martial arts class and how Emma had learned to expertly handle the nunchaku. He found it peculiar that such a unique weapon was the weapon of choice in Stella's demise. More peculiar and somewhat perplexing was how Emma would have found an opportunity to carry a pair of the increasingly rare weapon, nunchaku to the crime scene without anyone noticing. This case was turning out to be more intriguing than Winston had initially assumed; a fashion designer, a nunchaku, and a quiet kitchen.\n\nWhile smoking on his half-bitten down cigar, Winston rubbed the corner of his eye, trying to make sense of the gruesome, disarming photographs of Stella's murder scene in her own kitchen.\n\nThere was a mere few facts he had that could be of any substance for the detective, one of which was that nunchaku was held responsible for the cause of death, synonymous with martial arts, that made Winston think of Milton, a martial arts enthusiast appearing rather benign.\n\nAnother fact he'd picked up on was that Milton had been invited by Stella for dinner that fatal night. Winston stomped out his cigar, inaudibly muttered 'no holds barred,' and prepared to interview his suspect of interest - Milton.\n\nArriving at the local dojo, after a short spar, a sweat-drenched Milton, sporting his martial arts certification belt, made his way over to Winston.\n\n\"Hi Detective,\" greeted Milton offering a tepid smile.\n\n\"Milton,\" acknowledged Winston commenting, \"see you're stickin' to your trainin' regimen.\"\n\nAdjusting his martial arts belt, Milton nodded, \"It's a passion, yes sir, good way to keep fit.\"\n\n\"You were invited to Stella's last night for dinner, ain't that right?\" inquired Winston, his eyes never leaving Milton's face.\n\nTaken aback by Winston's sudden mention of Stella, Milton blurted, \"Y-yes.

The crime scene was hauntingly silent, yet William could still faintly hear the echoes of a crowd, a crowd that once chanted their names. He gazed at the trident left behind.

As Winston pulled up in front of Harper’s residence, her neighbours had only warm greetings for her. 'Ms. Olivia is so well-mannered, a real beacon to our community,' one old man mused with a smile.\n\n“Ms. Olivia?” Winston asked, stepping forward with an extended hand, deciding to go straight to the point, “Did you hear about Isabelle?”\n\n“Yes, a tragedy…” Harper replied, her eyes dodging his, evasively looking around, \"Isabelle... She threatened to uncover something...\" Her voice trailed off and her face was etched with tangible fear. It was clear that Harper was terrified of Isabelle's threat to expose her.\n\n“You were part of a local gladiator reenactment group, weren’t you?” Winston probed, aware from his sources that the group required serious physical preparation and training. Winston glanced at Harper’s tough physique; it made sense. He then gazed at the array of replica gladiatorial weapons displayed on the shelves behind Harper. She nodded rather reluctantly without saying a word.\n\nWinston, changing the topic, asked, “I hear your fascination with crime stretches beyond just books?”\n\nAfter a pause, Harper admitted, “Yes, I enjoy books about crime – a morbid fascination, you could say. The bookstore clerk sees me often, buying many crime novels. The members of my book club and I often have lively debates on forensics too.”\n\nConsidering her confession, Winston made a mental note to check the bookstore. Upon consultation with the local bookstore clerk, it was confirmed that Harper was a frequenter. She had been spotted buying novels from the true crime section multiple times.\n\nAccording to his sources, Isabelle knew Harper had been involved in some kind of illegal activities. In fact, the twisted secret that Isabelle threatened to reveal involved Harper’s clandestine dealings. \n\nBefore leaving, he remembered Harper rolling up her sleeves to shake his hand, and a retrospective glimpse of her physique leaving no doubt about the extensive physical conditioning she must undergo for her stash of staged battles, yet another piece of potential insight into the power and strength that Harper wielded. The pieces were beginning to fit into place, scattered fragments of a life lived under the radar.\n\nWinston pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to stave off the oncoming headache as he sifted through numerous witness statements. His mind kept coming back to one name: Lance. \n\nIsabelle and this Lance fellow were often seen together with Lance referring to her as his wife.

Lance had not been coy about admitting that he had indeed overheard this conversation.\n\nWinston's weary eyes moved towards the photos of the crime scene. The wrestling ring, normally throbbing with life, seemed void in the ominous light of the flash. Isabelle's life had ended here, in the very wrestling ring that was part of the event Lance was directing.\n\nAs he looked closely at a photo of the bloodied mat, his eyes drifted to a piece of prop laying just out of the boundary of the ring.

His voice was low and weary. \"I understand that you and Chloe had planned a sister-courtship to the movies last night.\"\n\nA flicker of surprise crossed Ruby's face. \"Why, yes. Chloe wanted to see that new film, The Scarlet Phoenix. We enjoyed a night at the theater till the very end. Nobody else entered or left the theater during our stay - it was just us.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" muttered Winston. \"And there were eyewitnesses confirming that you were the last person seen with Chloe?\" \n\n\"Yes,\" said Ruby hesitatingly,\"We departed together.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" muttered Winston, making no further comment. Instead, he considered the reported vision of Ruby seeing Chloe kissing another man. Another man who turned out to be Jake.\n\n\"I understand that you might have feelings for Jake. Is that right?\" Winston questioned, watching Ruby carefully.\n\nRuby hesitated, playing with the locket around her neck. “Yes, I suppose that's true,” she admitted, but never meeting his gaze.\n\nThe detective changed the angle of the conversation. “I've heard tales about your psychic abilities, Ruby. You tend to see dangerous things. Your visions included dreadful bomb scenarios back when you were in the military, right?”\n\n\"I've had visions,\" Ruby replied defensively. \"Visions are often ambiguous. They can symbolize various scenarios. I did see Chloe, Chloe kissing another man... Jake. And yes, during my service, I’ve seen how war and destruction unfold, even how to use grenades.\"\n\n\"I can imagine,\" Winston said, thinking to himself. Connecting the dots, he continued, \"Did you know that Jake and Chloe were secretly seeing each other?\"\n\nRuby's apprehension told Winston everything he needed to know. \"Yes, I knew.

Roscoe was indeed there before the movie started, now confirmed by the timing on his ticket. \n\nA confirmed nod came from Roscoe, who avoided meeting Winston’s gaze. \"Yeah, I was here. Same movie as her.\" His voice dropped lower. \"When the incident occurred during the movie screening. Chloe... She didn't make it.\"\n\nWinston hesitated, knowing Chloe's death wasn't the only thing he needed to discuss today. Throughout their conversation, Winston noticed a limp in Roscoe's step, bruises, and a sharp wince when he moved a certain way. \"Looks like you've got some injuries there,\" Winston remarked casually. \n\nThough he spoke offhandedly, Roscoe was quick to brush it off, often changing the subject when questioned about his injuries, which drew Winston’s attention. More so than before, Winston observed, people tended to notice when someone was deliberately avoiding a topic.\n\nTrying not to push too far, Winston paused momentarily - but then he remembered the drug bag found in Roscoe’s possession at the theater.

It was a terrible scene involving a grenade explosion, a midnight movie, and a tragedy. Winston ran a hand over his tired face as he recollected the events of the night.

Keira, an acclaimed actress, met a gruesome end somewhere above the clouds within the confines of an airplane. \n\nHe peered at the seating plan. Keira and a certain makeup-artist, Roy, had been ensconced close to each other. Roy's profession intrigued Winston. Being a makeup artist, Roy had open access to the movie props. In his regular line of duty, he had even been responsible for the movie props. Winston quietly wondered how Roy felt about handling props so deadly. The movie currently in production, as Winston learned, even had a sequence where a shotgun was fired. Apart from props, though, Roy was qualified to handle guns. The knowledge made Winston's eyes narrow, and a sense of unease lingered in the air.\n\nWinston turned his attention to the individual interviews. Part of his job, however unappealing. He questioned Roy's social circle, most of which agreed to having seen Roy use cocaine during parties. Roy himself confessed to his social indulgences— admitted his use of cocaine at similar social events. Winston found cocaine in his car during what was supposed to be a regular traffic stop. Even a casual search of his wallet at the scene had brought Winston into contact with traces of cocaine on Roy's dollar bills.\n\nWinston caught Roy at a moment when he was wide awake, clearly not burdened with any tasks at hand. He had been travelling with Keira for the upcoming movie shoot. They were setting up an interesting dynamic, and Winston found himself teetering on the edge of answers just beyond his grasp. As the evening drew closer to the end, a haunting stillness took hold over the airplane as Winston took notes, suitably filed away with an enigmatic makeup artist named Roy.\n\nAs Detective Winston sat in the bustling airport terminal, he couldn't shake the feeling that he had entered into a scene straight out of a soap opera. Keira, the victim, had been brutally shot on an airplane mid-flight. It beggared belief but, somehow, it weirdly made the situation even more intriguing, albeit less appealing. \n\nOn one side of the investigation was Angela, a woman who had ties everywhere – friend, confidante, protector, and presently, a suspect. Their history ran deep. Angela was a bridesmaid at Keira's wedding, had a notable protective streak for Keira's groom – Sam, and yet, was the primary person of interest. Winston made his way towards her, among the small group of wedding party attendees.\n\nWinston introduced himself to the shabby-looking Angela, \"Hello, Angela.\" Noting her silence, he continued, \"I heard you were in control of the suitcases for the wedding party?\"\n\nAngela responded, \"Yes, I was,\" her tone curt. \"They had my dresses, makeup, everyone's things... But, I didn't check them. Nobody did. We were a wedding party, not criminals!\" Her voice shook with emotion.\n\n\"Did I also hear correctly that you're frequently found hunting?\" Winston asked her. At this, Angela’s face lit up as she began to talk about her fondness for the sport, the serenity of the woods, the excitement of the chase, and her marksmanship skills that had even earned her a few awards. \n\nSam, in deep sorrow, was to their side, reflecting on his cold interactions with Keira during their last days together. As Winston headed towards Sam, Angela's focus followed.\n\nCognizant of Sam’s grief, Winston crouched next to him, saying, \"I heard matters between you and Keira had turned frosty recently, is that true?\" Sam merely nodded.\n\nMeanwhile, Angela was seen in a particularly heated conversation with a friend close by. Snippets of their conversation reached Winston, revealing Angela expressing her affection for Sam and resentment over Keira's plans to replace him after the trip. Angela had backed into a corner, recalling overhearing a devastating conversation – Keira telling a friend about her plan to dump Sam after the trip. \n\nThese bits and pieces of information swirled in Winston’s mind, a puzzle in the making. He knew it was vital to earn the trust of all those involved, a daunting task given that a whole wedding party was under suspicion. A wedding party that had flown together to attend what should have been a joyous occasion, now marred by tragedy and shrouded in mystery.\n\nAs Winston exited the lounge that day, he was gripped by an image – Angela, fiercely arguing with Keira. Angela, a woman in love with Sam, was openly confronting Keira over her plans to dump Sam. Had that argument led to this regrettable end? Only time would tell.

He had been travelling with Keira for the upcoming movie shoot. They were setting up an interesting dynamic, and Winston found himself teetering on the edge of answers just beyond his grasp. As the evening drew closer to the end, a haunting stillness took hold over the airplane as Winston took notes, suitably filed away with an enigmatic makeup artist named Roy.\\n\\nAs Detective Winston sat in the bustling airport terminal, he couldn't shake the feeling that he had entered into a scene straight out of a soap opera. Keira, the victim, had been brutally shot on an airplane mid-flight. It beggared belief but, somehow, it weirdly made the situation even more intriguing, albeit less appealing. \\n\\nOn one side of the investigation was Angela, a woman who had ties everywhere \\u2013 friend, confidante, protector, and presently, a suspect. Their history ran deep. Angela was a bridesmaid at Keira's wedding, had a notable protective streak for Keira's groom \\u2013 Sam, and yet, was the primary person of interest. Winston made his way towards her, among the small group of wedding party attendees.\\n\\nWinston introduced himself to the shabby-looking Angela, \\\"Hello, Angela.\\\" Noting her silence, he continued, \\\"I heard you were in control of the suitcases for the wedding party?\\\"\\n\\nAngela responded, \\\"Yes, I was,\\\" her tone curt. \\\"They had my dresses, makeup, everyone's things... But, I didn't check them. Nobody did. We were a wedding party, not criminals!\\\" Her voice shook with emotion.\\n\\n\\\"Did I also hear correctly that you're frequently found hunting?\\\" Winston asked her. At this, Angela\\u2019s face lit up as she began to talk about her fondness for the sport, the serenity of the woods, the excitement of the chase, and her marksmanship skills that had even earned her a few awards. \\n\\nSam, in deep sorrow, was to their side, reflecting on his cold interactions with Keira during their last days together. As Winston headed towards Sam, Angela's focus followed.\\n\\nCognizant of Sam\\u2019s grief, Winston crouched next to him, saying, \\\"I heard matters between you and Keira had turned frosty recently, is that true?\\\" Sam merely nodded.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Angela was seen in a particularly heated conversation with a friend close by. Snippets of their conversation reached Winston, revealing Angela expressing her affection for Sam and resentment over Keira's plans to replace him after the trip. Angela had backed into a corner, recalling overhearing a devastating conversation \\u2013 Keira telling a friend about her plan to dump Sam after the trip. \\n\\nThese bits and pieces of information swirled in Winston\\u2019s mind, a puzzle in the making. He knew it was vital to earn the trust of all those involved, a daunting task given that a whole wedding party was under suspicion. A wedding party that had flown together to attend what should have been a joyous occasion, now marred by tragedy and shrouded in mystery.\\n\\nAs Winston exited the lounge that day, he was gripped by an image \\u2013 Angela, fiercely arguing with Keira. Angela, a woman in love with Sam, was openly confronting Keira over her plans to dump Sam. Had that argument led to this regrettable end? Only time would tell. All he knew was, unravelling this convoluted puzzle was going to be a task.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Angela\\n(b) - Roy\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(a) - Angela"]], "filtered_resps": ["(a)"], "doc_hash": "5f945f42f7ab2bb5cd27d8e6b9ff2cc21224d25d889d494756441aee5005eae8", "prompt_hash": "f530d3a81d9d55dba61b2d6902b6a23ec92cf80b9baab39a710330405aea0d44", "target_hash": "e300f251dc09073a9781733cd99758d04a98290157b77fb5c4a986b123900fc6", "exact_match": 0.0}

The wedding party, including Keira and Angela, had travelled together to the destination for the wedding. \n\nAs he took a sip of his lukewarm coffee, he forced down the bitter taste, and turned his attention to the suspect in question; Angela, the Maid of Honor. Apparently, she had been quite the participant in Keira’s wedding party; even had the responsibility for the suitcases.\n\nKeira's life seemed to have ended prematurely, and one piece of information struck Winston immediately. Keira and Angela were reported to have had a fierce argument over Sam, Keira's boyfriend. From what he could gather, Angela had more than platonic feelings towards Sam. She had been spotted several times, gazing at him at the party with longing in her eyes. Furthermore, it seemed Angela knew a secret. Keira was planning to dump Sam after their trip, leaving him heartbroken. This argument about Sam and Angela's secret feelings towards him, seemed like a potential motive.\n\nAs Winston flipped through the case files, a detail about Angela's past caught his eye.

Winston knew he needed answers. The puzzle wasn’t complete.

Besides artfully painting faces, he handled the props and was even a certified gun handler, quite an unusual combination of skills, Winston thought not for the first time.\n\nFinally, Roy sauntered into the room, looking dishevelled but alert despite the insanely late hour. His eyes, through years of experience, immediately began to scrutinize Winston's face as if preparing to apply foundation and concealer.\n\nBefore his eyes could do his work, Winston began. \"Mr. Roy, could you explain a bit about your relationship with Ms. Keira?\"\n\nRoy's face muscle twitched noticeably at his question. Resisting the urge to highlight this, Winston continued.\n\n\"Were you two traveling together for the movie shoot?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Roy murmured. \"She was seated near me during the flight.\" Winston then chose to ease into a more delicate topic to officially address the rumor. \"The passengers reported seeing Keira being intimate with another man on the flight, a man who was not you.

Otis, the victim, would most definitely be missed. His usual vibrant energy that filled the hockey rink was replaced by cold, solemn silence.\n\nSome contradictions needed to be resolved. The crime scene at the hockey rink was empty, both at the time of the murder and throughout the investigation. Winston's only lead was Andrew, who was an old military pal of Otis. Winston heard that Andrew had recently switched his career to become a solo hiking guide. Indeed, a remarkable part of his solo hikes was his ability to help hikers they came across on the way overcome environmental dangers—a way of applying his skills acquired from his military service. It was an unusual practice in the industry but allowed due to his military expertise in bomb disposal—an odd career choice for a man of such skills.\n\nWinston drove to the outskirts of the town, where Andrew lived in a remote cabin.

Otis was always open with Andrew about his daily habits, even shared his calendar with him. Andrew was the only person who knew Otis would be alone at the hockey rink that evening.\n\nOn his way out, Winston remembered Andrew's frank words, \"I don't like to hang out after work.”\n\nIt seemed somewhat true, living far from town, working alone, and being prone to avoid after-work hangouts.

However, he couldn't draw any obvious conclusions just yet. He needed more.\n\nDetective Winston sat on the chilly bleachers of the local hockey rink, a place as familiar to him as it was to Ervin, the mild-mannered Rabbi who had never missed a game. The rink was still splattered with telltale signs of the merciless violence that had taken place there. Otis had been killed during a game, a seemingly jovial event turned nightmarish by the unexpected detonation of a grenade.\n\nTaking his eyes off the crime scene momentarily, he scanned his surroundings and spotted his next person of interest: Ervin, a massive hockey fan, and a staunch supporter of their local team. His presence at the game had been expected, as his dedicated attendance was part of the everyday routine.

{"doc_id": 21, "doc": {"narrative": "In the cold echo of a deserted hockey rink, Otis was found dead from a grenade explosion, and now Detective Winston must decipher the clues, suspecting Ervin and Andrew are somehow involved.\n\nWinston let out a pensive sigh as the medical examiner rattled off the factors that spelled foul play, namely the shrapnel directly linked to a grenade. When you see something new, you remember it, he mused.\n\nThe town had been buzzing since Ervin's angry outburst in the synagogue last Sunday. Bystanders had recounted to Winston how Ervin had been shouting at a particular customer he had been consulting with, before the outburst escalated and he stormed off into the synagogue. The same customer Walter Harrison was who Ervin had consulted with before he stormed off into the synagogue, had recounted it to him with fear in his voice.\n\n\"And you say you were trembling after the confrontation, Mr. Harrison?\" Winston asked after the customer finished recounting Ervin's worrying reaction.\n\n\"N-not just a confrontation,\" the distressed customer stammered, \"Ervin, our Rabbi, he lost it – punching the walls, shouting at everyone. There’s still a visible dent where he hit.\"\n\nWinston gave a slight nod, “Thank you for your cooperation,” he said before heading toward the synagogue to track down Rabbi Ervin.\n\nErvin Thornberg, the Rabbi, met Winston's inquiring gaze coolly. Ervin had a hardened look - the clear evidence of his military past. He was known in town as former military officer with specialized training in demolitions. Nothing could erase that part of his life.\n\n\"Quite an impressive array of memorabilia here, Rabbi,\" Winston remarked, scanning the room filled with various wartime relics like grenades and medals from Ervin's service days. \"Your friends often tell stories of you proudly showing these off.\"\n\n\"Careful with those, Detective, they are from my time in the service,\" Ervin replied, with a hint of nostalgia creeping into his tone. \"My friends, they have a way of making things sound more dramatic.\"\n\nWinston was further intrigued by the hint of gossip he received from one of Ervin's neighbors, \"You know, Otis had been vocal lately. He saw something he shouldn't about Ervin and the synagogue funds. Even said he was planning to go to the authorities.\"\n\nWith that information, Winston pitched it to Ervin, \"I hear Otis saw something alarming involving you and the synagogue's funds. Heard he was seriously considering going to the authorities.\"\n\nErvin stiffened noticeably, his cool gaze flickered for a moment. \"Otis talks too much,\" he muttered, a subtle hint of annoyance in his tone.\n\nJust as he was about to leave, a troubling fact popped back into his mind - Otis. Otis had seen Ervin embezzling funds from the Synagogue and Ervin knew that. Winston marked it down mentally and with a brisk nod to Rabbi Ervin, made his exit. Feeling the sharp gaze of Ervin boring into his back, he needed no further confirmation.\n\nThe pieces were neatly aligning, like pieces of a puzzle, Winston could see it - But it wasn't his place to tell the story, rather gather it. So with another sigh, he slid into the driver's seat and drove off. The knot in his gut tightened as he pulled away from the synagogue - he knew his work here was far from done.\n\nWinston pulled the collar of his jacket up and stepped into the freezing cold of the hockey rink. Alone in the rink, he squinted under the heat of the artificial light to read the deserted stands and make out the chalk lines: \"Just a man and his routine...Otis was always here at this time, when no one else was present...So why Otis? Why here?\"\n\nHours later, Winston found himself wading through the mud and foliage of a nearby hiking trail. He was there to meet Andrew, the local hiking guide, a formally trained Bomb Disposal Technician in the military, and a close friend of Otis. Andrew's hiking business had been losing traction for quite some time. His soldier-like formality was still intact, standing tall despite the fall of his flailing business, which was evident through alarming financial reports showing consistent and increasing negative balance in his accounts.\n\n\"Right this way, detective.\" Andrew offered, leading him through the dense woods with the authority and precision that only a man with his specialized training would possess. Andrew diligently used his army skills to ensure the safety of hikers from any potential environmental dangers on their guided tours.\n\n\"Andrew-\" Winston began, striding to keep up with the trained speedwalker, \"I was told you two were close. And you had asked Otis about his insurance policy recently. Care to shed some light on that?\"\n\nAndrew did not look back as he continued walking. \"Sure did. Otis had been open about his routine. I always knew when he was at the rink or off somewhere else.

When you see something new, you remember it, he mused.\\n\\nThe town had been buzzing since Ervin's angry outburst in the synagogue last Sunday. Bystanders had recounted to Winston how Ervin had been shouting at a particular customer he had been consulting with, before the outburst escalated and he stormed off into the synagogue. The same customer Walter Harrison was who Ervin had consulted with before he stormed off into the synagogue, had recounted it to him with fear in his voice.\\n\\n\\\"And you say you were trembling after the confrontation, Mr. Harrison?\\\" Winston asked after the customer finished recounting Ervin's worrying reaction.\\n\\n\\\"N-not just a confrontation,\\\" the distressed customer stammered, \\\"Ervin, our Rabbi, he lost it \\u2013 punching the walls, shouting at everyone. There\\u2019s still a visible dent where he hit.\\\"\\n\\nWinston gave a slight nod, \\u201cThank you for your cooperation,\\u201d he said before heading toward the synagogue to track down Rabbi Ervin.\\n\\nErvin Thornberg, the Rabbi, met Winston's inquiring gaze coolly. Ervin had a hardened look - the clear evidence of his military past. He was known in town as former military officer with specialized training in demolitions. Nothing could erase that part of his life.\\n\\n\\\"Quite an impressive array of memorabilia here, Rabbi,\\\" Winston remarked, scanning the room filled with various wartime relics like grenades and medals from Ervin's service days. \\\"Your friends often tell stories of you proudly showing these off.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Careful with those, Detective, they are from my time in the service,\\\" Ervin replied, with a hint of nostalgia creeping into his tone. \\\"My friends, they have a way of making things sound more dramatic.\\\"\\n\\nWinston was further intrigued by the hint of gossip he received from one of Ervin's neighbors, \\\"You know, Otis had been vocal lately. He saw something he shouldn't about Ervin and the synagogue funds. Even said he was planning to go to the authorities.\\\"\\n\\nWith that information, Winston pitched it to Ervin, \\\"I hear Otis saw something alarming involving you and the synagogue's funds. Heard he was seriously considering going to the authorities.\\\"\\n\\nErvin stiffened noticeably, his cool gaze flickered for a moment. \\\"Otis talks too much,\\\" he muttered, a subtle hint of annoyance in his tone.\\n\\nJust as he was about to leave, a troubling fact popped back into his mind - Otis. Otis had seen Ervin embezzling funds from the Synagogue and Ervin knew that. Winston marked it down mentally and with a brisk nod to Rabbi Ervin, made his exit. Feeling the sharp gaze of Ervin boring into his back, he needed no further confirmation.\\n\\nThe pieces were neatly aligning, like pieces of a puzzle, Winston could see it - But it wasn't his place to tell the story, rather gather it. So with another sigh, he slid into the driver's seat and drove off. The knot in his gut tightened as he pulled away from the synagogue - he knew his work here was far from done.\\n\\nWinston pulled the collar of his jacket up and stepped into the freezing cold of the hockey rink. Alone in the rink, he squinted under the heat of the artificial light to read the deserted stands and make out the chalk lines: \\\"Just a man and his routine...Otis was always here at this time, when no one else was present...So why Otis? Why here?\\\"\\n\\nHours later, Winston found himself wading through the mud and foliage of a nearby hiking trail. He was there to meet Andrew, the local hiking guide, a formally trained Bomb Disposal Technician in the military, and a close friend of Otis. Andrew's hiking business had been losing traction for quite some time. His soldier-like formality was still intact, standing tall despite the fall of his flailing business, which was evident through alarming financial reports showing consistent and increasing negative balance in his accounts.\\n\\n\\\"Right this way, detective.\\\" Andrew offered, leading him through the dense woods with the authority and precision that only a man with his specialized training would possess. Andrew diligently used his army skills to ensure the safety of hikers from any potential environmental dangers on their guided tours.\\n\\n\\\"Andrew-\\\" Winston began, striding to keep up with the trained speedwalker, \\\"I was told you two were close. And you had asked Otis about his insurance policy recently. Care to shed some light on that?\\\"\\n\\nAndrew did not look back as he continued walking. \\\"Sure did. Otis had been open about his routine. I always knew when he was at the rink or off somewhere else. As for his insurance, he had approached me for advice and later updated it, naming me the beneficiary.\\\"\\n\\nAs they neared Andrew's hiking spot, Winston noticed a military-grade tent with tools, knives, ropes, canned food supplies, and hidden among them, explosives.

Autumn froze for a moment before returning to her normal composure. \"He trusted you,\" I said, \"would have let you in the bunker.\"\n\n\"The bunker? Yeah, I know the place. Donald used to talk about it,\" she replied, trying to sound nonchalant.

I could still walk through it blindfolded.\"\n\n\"And isolated…\" Winston added, his gaze never leaving Jay's face.

Something didn't sit right, there was always more to the story than what laid bare, Winston knew this. \n\nHis latest lead led him to Autumn, the only person Donald would have willingly let inside his survival bunker. Before Donald’s unanticipated retreat to his bunker, he had mentioned his intent to her. The two of them were old acquaintances, sharing a history few knew of, having been in a criminal gang together. Donald was more trusting than most, in fact, Autumn was the only person he would trust when it came to sharing such a secluded spot. His survival bunker was his safe haven, where he was known to retreat when the world became too loud. \n\nMaybe it was her psychic abilities that drew him in - Autumn did have a knack for knowing things before they happened. Or maybe it was her unique collection of pets she so lovingly tended to. Her pets came with a singular bite, a serpentine collection that few dared to keep. As the sole caretaker of these reptiles, she also had intimate knowledge of their venom, which she knew could prove deadly for Donald.\n\nEven fewer knew about Autumn's illicit past, dark secrets tangled up with crimes committed years ago; secrets that could have turned disastrous had they been revealed. She feared the consequences that awaited her, fearing her darkest secrets could be unveiled leading to her undoing.\n\nAnd then there was Donald. He had always been a reliable man. A straight shooter who stood up for what he believed was right, even if it got in the way of his personal well-being.\n\n\"I'd heard a rumor, Autumn,\" started Winston, meeting her outside her reptile enclosure, \"Heard that Donald found out you were back to your old tricks.\"\n\nAutumn's eyes widened just a tiny bit, almost imperceptible, a reaction only someone with Winston's training would catch.\n\n\"Imagine his surprise,\" continued Winston, \"down in the bunker alone, knowing his old friend is involved in illegal matters again.\" \n\nAutumn was silent, staring at the detective with an unreadable expression. \n\nDonald's fatal allergy to snake venom was not a widely known fact, but one that Autumn was well aware of. Yet, Winston couldn't help but notice, but Autumn's snakes seemed to be unfazed and peaceful in their glass enclosures.

Donald's murder was an unusual one, a death by snake venom. He had always thought that underground bunkers were safe; this case was proving him wrong. \n\nWord on the street was that Jay was quite the character. A missionary, stationed in a region notorious for snakes, missionaries of that region were trained to extract snake venom due to the frequent encounters with these creatures. Winston lit a cigarette as he thought about Jay's training. It seemed unusual for a man of god, but Winston quickly reminded himself that his job was not to question, rather to understand. \n\nHe stepped out of his office, coffee in hand, and made his way to the local church.

Adding to that, Jay never gave away a hint of his personal life during their meeting, always twisting the conversation towards his missionary tales. \n\nDespite this, Winston listened attentively.

Max ran a popular art dealership in town, claiming to deal with artifacts too, and his reputation had charmed many art enthusiasts, including Dwayne. \n\nUpon knocking, the door creaked open. Winston found himself in a large living space, filled with exquisite pieces of art, including a rather unique sickle, which was oddly intriguing.\n\n\"Max?\" Winston called out, taking care not to disturb the artifacts around him.\n\nMax returned from another room, a pleased grin on his face, his eyes kindling with pride,\" Ah, detective, welcome to my humble abode.\"\n\nMax was a known art dealer who wasn't just after profit but cherished the art of curating a meaningful collection. From Winston's observation, Max appeared to be highly concerned about his reputation in this field.\n\nWhen Winston asked, \"Did Dwayne visit you last night?”, from the corner of his eye he noticed a flicker of unease cross Max’s face. Max hesitated before answering, \"Yes, Detective. He wanted to take a look at my collection... he had a soft spot for historical farming artifacts.\"\n\nAs they chatted, Max admitted to giving Dwayne a ride afterward as Dwayne was his guest, and thought it only right to drive him back. Dwayne was seated in the passenger's seat of Max's car, he had said. It was in this same car where Dwayne's lifeless body was found later. \n\n\"So it was just the two of you going to the car?\", Winston clarified, to which Max nodded, confirming that he was last seen with Dwayne heading towards the car.\n\nAs the discussion continued, Winston learnt from Max about an upcoming exhibit, where Dwayne planned to expose an inauthentic artifact in Max's collection, something that threatened Max’s reputation.\n\nOn leaving, Winston couldn't help but echo the words of an old mentor.

The room was a silent symphony of colors and emotions, none of which were gold. But gold was the color he was concerning himself with today.

Instagram photos and notes, discovered by Xochitl, declared that Olivia had intentions to seriously harm Xochitl's sister and ruin her life. Olivia's actions had extended to constant harassment, as per statements from numerous local residents. \n\nThat's when Winston set his eyes on Xochitl for the first time. A town local, known for conducting regular Tarot readings, she was known to have a strong inclination towards rituals and esoteric practices. The temple was often her stage for spiritual enlightenment, which required the uncorking of ritualistic wine bottles with a trusty corkscrew, a habit she had grown accustomed to.\n\nWinston approached her while she was meticulously packing away her Tarot cards, her dark, expressive eyes betraying a myriad of deep emotions. \"Are you always this involved in your...ritual practices?\" he asked, noting her obvious devotion. \"Yes,\" she responded, her voice barely rising above the rustling of her Tarot cards. \"It has become a part of me, something very close to my heart.\"\n\nWinston paused before asking about her trips. Xochitl's expression faltered a bit as she looked at him, then away. \"They happen now and then,\" she said calmly, swiftly changing the subject to the next upcoming spiritual gathering. Winston noted that her trips were far from listed on her nearby calendar, a fact he filed away on his internal docket.\n\nConversation shifted, and Xochitl showered her sister with affection. She shared a story of a recent conflict Olivia had with her sister, one laced with threats to ruin her life. The passion with which Xochitl narrated the story was palpable.\n\nAs Winston was exiting, he caught sight of various trinkets littered around Xochitl's space. A glance at one of the suitcase tags confirmed it had an origin from a foreign country. He recalls how the locals often gossiped about Xochitl bringing back a new trinket or souvenir from each trip she made, adding to her ever-growing collection. It was the same country that matched one of Xochitl's passport stamps -- a souvenir from her unmarked trips perhaps. The details of her travels remained shrouded in mystery, with Xochitl deftly avoiding deeper conversations about these.\n\n\"I'll speak with you soon, Xochitl,\" Winston affirmed as he left, feeling a complex web of possibilities dissecting in his mind. Curious about the tie between Xochitl, her mysterious trips, the souvenirs and the tragic murder, he was determined to peel back the layers of ambiguity surrounding this case.\n\nIn the wake of the unfortunate event at the local temple, Detective Winston flipped through the details of the victims. A familiar sense of dread had come to accompany the name of Olivia – similar to the other women whose investigations he had compiled over time, yet still distinctly unique. It spurred the creeping sensation of a suspected serial killer at large.\n\n“There’s something about this delivery guy…” he murmured, pulling a file, filled with suspicions, on Martin, a package delivery driver. Winston had previously handled several investigations related to Martin for similar incidents, but they had all gone cold. “Is it déjà vu?”\n\nHe shuffled through the documents in Martin's file. The delivery man, as per his employer’s statement, made regular visits to the temple for his deliveries, which interestingly enough, had also happened on the fateful day Olivia was found dead. Today, he was scheduled to deliver a package to none other than Olivia herself.\n\nAs Winston read further, he scratched the stubble on his chin, remembering a tidbit he had come across in one of the previous investigations. Martin had this... peculiar method of opening packages, using a corkscrew. Yes, a corkscrew of all things. And that was a part of his regular equipment, he would carry it with him every day.\n\nQuirkily, during an early afternoon surveillance encounter upon one of his visits at the temple on the very day of the murder, Martin was seen carrying his odd tool, the corkscrew.\n\n\"It's ironic, don't you think?\" One of his fellow officers had remarked dryly. \"Our potential serial killer and his corkscrew.\"\n\nWinston refrained from comment, remembering the discrepancies that had led those cases to grow cold. Several of them were left inconclusive - always touch and go - with evidence that went around in circles but never quite completed the picture.\n\nAs he went through his notes, Winston noticed another uncanny resemblance - Olivia was quite similar in appearance to the past victims; young, brunette, and striking eyes.\n\nFingers drumming against the cool, polished surface of his wooden desk, Winston reviewed Martin’s work log. It noted the driver was prescheduled enough to have him at the temple around the suspected time of Olivia’s demise that day. With furrowed brows, he made note of the temple's solitary condition during the time - not another soul around.\n\nToo many coincidences and not enough clarity. Winston sighed heavily, clicking his pen shut. The more things unravelled, the more they seemed convoluted. But he knew better than to pinpoint connections.

Today, he was scheduled to deliver a package to none other than Olivia herself.\\n\\nAs Winston read further, he scratched the stubble on his chin, remembering a tidbit he had come across in one of the previous investigations. Martin had this... peculiar method of opening packages, using a corkscrew. Yes, a corkscrew of all things. And that was a part of his regular equipment, he would carry it with him every day.\\n\\nQuirkily, during an early afternoon surveillance encounter upon one of his visits at the temple on the very day of the murder, Martin was seen carrying his odd tool, the corkscrew.\\n\\n\\\"It's ironic, don't you think?\\\" One of his fellow officers had remarked dryly. \\\"Our potential serial killer and his corkscrew.\\\"\\n\\nWinston refrained from comment, remembering the discrepancies that had led those cases to grow cold. Several of them were left inconclusive - always touch and go - with evidence that went around in circles but never quite completed the picture.\\n\\nAs he went through his notes, Winston noticed another uncanny resemblance - Olivia was quite similar in appearance to the past victims; young, brunette, and striking eyes.\\n\\nFingers drumming against the cool, polished surface of his wooden desk, Winston reviewed Martin\\u2019s work log. It noted the driver was prescheduled enough to have him at the temple around the suspected time of Olivia\\u2019s demise that day. With furrowed brows, he made note of the temple's solitary condition during the time - not another soul around.\\n\\nToo many coincidences and not enough clarity. Winston sighed heavily, clicking his pen shut. The more things unravelled, the more they seemed convoluted. But he knew better than to pinpoint connections.

Beside the main floor was a separate storage area, cleverly concealed and invisible from the sales floor - tucked away in a quiet corner where no customer could see. Salesmen were bustling about, attempting to close deals and lure in unsuspecting customers. His gaze settled on a particular man, who was rather keenly explaining the mileage of a specific model to a customer: Miles.\n\n\"Mr. Miles,\" Winston greeted in his stern tone, interrupting the technical talk about mileage.\n\n\"Sorry, sir. I'm deep in a conversation,\" he said, not looking up from the customer.\n\n\"I believe this is more important,\" Winston replied, flashing his badge.\n\nMiles made an excuse to the customer and led Winston toward the hidden storage room, away from the prying eyes of the staff and customers. Entering the secretive area that no other employee had set foot in, Miles seemed visibly unnerved, surrounded by nothing but stacks of tires and car parts. \n\n\"Is there something wrong, detective?\" He asked, subtly glancing at the locked door behind him.\n\n\"Miles, I want to talk to you about Sophie. I understand you were both in the wrestling match. Quite the tough opponent you had there.\" Winston began. \n\nMiles cleared his throat, \"Well, we were more than just opponents in the ring. We've had our issues politically too.\"\n\n\"I'm aware,\" Winston said curtly, noticing Miles turning defensive.\n\n\"Sophie possessed evidence against you, she found out about money laundering carried out through this dealership, perhaps?\" Winston probed. \n\nMiles shifted uncomfortably; his complexion changed and he cast his eyes down nervously. \"I...I don't know what you're talking about, Detective.\" \n\nWinston sternly replied, \"Sophie planned to reveal these illegal acts. You knew it, didn’t you? She was about to expose your whole operation.”\n\n\"Anyone would want to protect their livelihood, Detective,” retorted Miles, avoiding Winston's piercing gaze.\n\n\"I see,\" Winston said calmly assessing the situation, \"It seems no one else knows what you do in this storage room Miles.\"\n\n“Well, it's my dealership, my storage. Do I need an audience now?\" Miles retorted, frustration creeping into his voice.\n\nDeciding to change gears a bit, Winston asked, \"Say, Miles, you sponsor anyone in Sophie's campaign?\"\n\n\"Actually I do, I have been secretly financing a competing candidate in Sophie's campaign.\" Revealed Miles with a mischievous grin, sensing no immediate danger. \n\n\"Ah, hedging your bets, are we?\" Winston concluded.\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston said, ending the conversation. He finished up his lukewarm coffee, thanked Mr. Miles for his time, and walked out of the concealed storage room, leaving Miles behind in the stuffy room of tires and car parts. \n\nAs he meandered through the dealership, Winston thought about what Miles had said and not said.

His career as a chiropractor not only required him using protective tools like support belts and gloves, but also a familiarity with the human anatomy that would be advantageous in a wrestling match.

{"doc_id": 32, "doc": {"narrative": "In the quiet solitude of a local library, Philip is found shockingly murdered with a barbed wire, leaving Detective Winston with the arduous task of sifting truth from alibis of the two main suspects, Hugo and Maria.\n\nStepping into the library, a sea of hushed whispers and tiptoeing patrons, detective Winston began his appointment with Hugo. Navigating his way through the maze of bookshelves and study cubicles, he found the man seated in a corner, engrossed in a tangle of wires and knobs. Hugo was a sound engineer. The smorgasbord of tools and wires – even a wild-looking barbed one often used in some peculiar sound gigs-, extending around him served as a testament to his profession and the variety of venues he worked in.\n\n\"Mr. Hugo?\" Winston interrupted, his voice barely a notch above a whisper. Hugo nodded, eyelids still glued to his work. \"I'm detective Winston. I hope I'm not interrupting,\" he casually commented, glancing at the array of wiring tangled in the engineer's hands. \n\nHe took notice of the barbed wire amongst the mix. A trace of unease settled in the back of his mind as he recalled the crime scene images: Philip, lifeless in the library-turned-crime scene, surrounded by scattered books and barbed wire.\n\nAfter a moment, Hugo paused his work and leaned back, engaging the detective. Hugo mentioned a sound engineering job he was working on at the library at the time of Philip's murder. His work, he explained, often brought him to quiet, empty venues like this after dark, be it a library, an amphitheater, or something else entirely, each requiring specific types of wires and tools, barbed wire included.\n\n\"Bit of an unusual pick, isn't it?\" Winston tried to sound nonchalant.\n\nHugo chuckled, revealing a collection of rare and unusual wires he'd acquired as part of his professional routines. He casually referred to his atypical collection as an occupational hazard, barbed wire included.\n\nThe conversation somehow segued to Hugo's family, particularly his brother. \"He's not the responsible, betting kind,\" Hugo sighed, mentioning a lost gamble that cost his brother significantly. \"Between you and me,\" he leaned in to confide, \"Philip could be pretty aggressive when it came to his debts. In fact, he was known to resort to physical violence to get his way, a tendency that worried me always.\"\n\nDetective Winston couldn't help but ask, \"Did you confront him about it?\"\n\n\"No, but...\" Hugo hesitated before confessing a private phone call he overheard between Philip and his brother. Philip, as per Hugo, had not minced words in expressing his threats. \n\nWith his booked time slot over, Hugo readied to leave. Winston noticed the lights around them were already shutting down.

The salon itself was bustling, filled with happy chatter and the occasional hum of hair dryers. He was taken in by the sight of Maria, a veteran hairdresser of over 15 years, working diligently on a customer's hair, using an abundance of sharp tools, from scissors to razors.\n\n\"Maria?\" called Winston.\n\nShe looked up, her eyes catching the sheen of the barbed hairpins on her tray. They looked dangerously sharp - almost eerily similar to barbed wire.\n\n\"Yes, that's me! Can I help you?\" Maria responded.\n\n\"Just have a few questions,\" Winston muttered. \n\nMaria's salon, open until 10 pm every evening, was bustling. As he waited for Maria to finish with her current client, he couldn't help but notice a large unidentifiable bag resting in the corner. \n\nMaria then joined Winston, washing her hands before sitting across from him. \"Detective, isn't it?\" she said, having picked up on his official demeanor. \n\n\"I often see you at the library,\" Winston started, hoping his observation could break the ice.\n\nMaria's eyes twinkled as she answered, \"Yes, that's true. I find it soothing to visit the library after I close the salon at 10 pm. It's open till then, making it a perfect addition to my schedule.\"\n\nThey went on, revealing Maria's deep connection with the library—it came to the point where she became one of its registered trustees and was trusted with its key.\n\nLater, the conversation shifted to her closing activities at the salon. It didn't take long for Winston to realize the purpose of the large unidentifiable bag. After closing, Maria would routinely transport this bag to her car trunk, which she conveniently parked just outside.\n\n\"I heard from a neighbor that they've seen you cleaning your car in the parking lot after midnight,\" Winston remarked.\n\nMaria simply nodded, unfazed. \"Yes, I tidy up my car after a long day at the salon. I usually carry my cleaning supplies in there—it's easier to keep things clean on the go.\"\n\nThe conversation then took a darker turn. Winston disclosed the tragic news of Philip's demise—he had been found murdered in the library. His time of death coincidentally coincided with Maria's usual visits. The revelation hung heavy in the air, but Winston, true to his role, kept his thoughts in check. His job was to collect information.

Navigating his way through the maze of bookshelves and study cubicles, he found the man seated in a corner, engrossed in a tangle of wires and knobs. Hugo was a sound engineer. The smorgasbord of tools and wires \\u2013 even a wild-looking barbed one often used in some peculiar sound gigs-, extending around him served as a testament to his profession and the variety of venues he worked in.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Hugo?\\\" Winston interrupted, his voice barely a notch above a whisper.

I hope I'm not interrupting,\\\" he casually commented, glancing at the array of wiring tangled in the engineer's hands. \\n\\nHe took notice of the barbed wire amongst the mix. A trace of unease settled in the back of his mind as he recalled the crime scene images: Philip, lifeless in the library-turned-crime scene, surrounded by scattered books and barbed wire.\\n\\nAfter a moment, Hugo paused his work and leaned back, engaging the detective. Hugo mentioned a sound engineering job he was working on at the library at the time of Philip's murder. His work, he explained, often brought him to quiet, empty venues like this after dark, be it a library, an amphitheater, or something else entirely, each requiring specific types of wires and tools, barbed wire included.\\n\\n\\\"Bit of an unusual pick, isn't it?\\\" Winston tried to sound nonchalant.\\n\\nHugo chuckled, revealing a collection of rare and unusual wires he'd acquired as part of his professional routines. He casually referred to his atypical collection as an occupational hazard, barbed wire included.\\n\\nThe conversation somehow segued to Hugo's family, particularly his brother. \\\"He's not the responsible, betting kind,\\\" Hugo sighed, mentioning a lost gamble that cost his brother significantly. \\\"Between you and me,\\\" he leaned in to confide, \\\"Philip could be pretty aggressive when it came to his debts. In fact, he was known to resort to physical violence to get his way, a tendency that worried me always.\\\"\\n\\nDetective Winston couldn't help but ask, \\\"Did you confront him about it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, but...\\\" Hugo hesitated before confessing a private phone call he overheard between Philip and his brother.

{"doc_id": 33, "doc": {"narrative": "In the quiet solitude of a local library, Philip is found shockingly murdered with a barbed wire, leaving Detective Winston with the arduous task of sifting truth from alibis of the two main suspects, Hugo and Maria.\n\nWinston's mind was buzzing during the ride to the local hair salon, a tragic incident sinking his spirits. Philip, a library frequenter, was dead, with dire circumstances suggesting a gruesome murder. The weapon, a coil of barbed wire, unusual for sure. As he walked into the salon, he saw a middle-aged woman, Maria with a multitude of barbed hairpins reflecting ominously under the lights. She was working away with a pair of scissors, her nimble fingers managing both the razor and the various hairpins with the dexterity of an artist.\n\n\"Maria?\" Winston asked.\n\nCaught off guard, Maria looked up, her eyes wide in surprise. \"Yes, detective, can I help you with something?\" she answered, never pausing her delicate dance of grooming. She clicked her scissors, moved on to her razor, then her infamous collection of barbed hairpins, all with the practiced ease of someone in her profession for a long time. \n\n\"I hear you've been doing this for over fifteen years?\" he asked, partially making small talk, partially feeling out the woman in front of him.\n\n\"Sixteen years, next Tuesday.\" She replied, her gaze deliberately focused on her current client's head. \n\n\"Quite a long time...\" Winston said, thoughtful. \"You ever do hair for a fellow called Philip?\"\n\nMaria paused for a moment, her eyes downcast. \"Yes, I did his hair once. He's the one found in the library, right?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Winston nodded, \"I heard about your usual evening strolls to the library. The one open late till 10 pm?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's quiet, peaceful. They don't mind if I bring my coffee inside. I even have a key, just in case I lose track of time and it's closing,\" Maria disclosed.\n\n\"I see. How about Robert? Phillip's fiance. He been here, recently?\" Winston changed the subject.\n\nMaria swallowed and cleared her throat, stepping away from her customer to face Winston. \"Yes, he came... to talk.\" \n\n\"To talk about the wedding, or about that time in high school where you confessed your love to him before he proposed to Philip?\" Winston probed.\n\nMaria averted her eyes, \"About the wedding... but, yes, we also brought up the past. I've been in love with Robert since high school, and I've been secretly carrying that love for years, you know.\"\n\nWinston observed Maria. Things certainly aren't always as they seem, he thought, as she returned to her client, her barbed hairpins dancing in the slightly unsettling light. The fact that the time of Philip's death aligned eerily with Maria's usual library visit was an added layer of unease. \"Well, Robert's supposed to marry Philip soon, isn't he?\" \n\n\"Yes, but things aren't always as they seem, detective.\" Maria's voice held an edge as she responded, her gaze being both hurt yet defiant, hinting at a deeper tale yet to unravel.\n\nBlowing off steam, jumping from coffee shop to coffee shop, Winston was back on track, unanswered questions regarding Philip's mysterious murder bouncing in his mind. Known for his capacity for violence to get what he wanted, Philip had a reputation; ironically, barbed wire, his common form of conflict resolution, had been the weapon.\n\nThe detectives at the precinct were all a twitter about the eccentric sound technician, Hugo. Out of all potential suspects they'd drawn in, one thing about Hugo was blinking on Winston's radar. Not once had any colleague, friend or customer ever been invited to his personal studio where Hugo spent most of his time. The man was protective of his private space, it seemed. \n\n\"I'm detouring to Hugo's office,\" Winston informed his partner as he made a left turn.\n\nThe professional layout of Hugo's studio stood testament to his skills. Winston noticed the different categories of wires neatly stowed away, labeled by type. Spools of common wires were neatly packed, then his gaze floated towards an unusual collection of unique wires, barbed wire included, labeled 'personal collection'. He stroked one with his gloved fingers, lost in thought.\n\n\"Hugo,\" Winston called for his attention, \"This is some impressive collection. Not everyone works with barbed wire in a sound system, huh?\" Hugo's smile was gentle, \"I just like to keep my wire knowledge versatile,\" he shrugged.\n\n\"I heard you missed out on this year's industry conference,\" Winston inquired casually. \n\n\"Yeah. Conferences are not my cup of tea,\" Hugo chuckled, \"Too much show and too little know. I prefer focusing on the actual job, here in my studio.\"\n\nCasual chat moved reflective as Winston asked about Philip, \"What about Philip? Ever get into a formal tussle with him?\" Hugo's rifle through a box of cables paused, \"No direct confrontation, sir, but I was an unfortunate audience to threats he made to my brother over a phone call. Nastiest conversation ever.\"\n\nWinston nodded, taking in the distraught sound engineer before himself. Hugo's brother owed a significant amount to Philip, everyone and their nephew knew that.

The emails between Iris and Paige showed a scheduled meeting for the day of the murder. He looked over to Iris's company accounts and noticed a fall in profits that had been happening over some time. \n\n\"Is there anyone from Iris's family that could take over the company?\" he asked his  young assistant who was pouring over police reports in the corner. \n\n\"No, she didn't have any family,\" the assistant called back. \n\nAs Winston dig deeper into the case, he found that Paige, as Iris's direct subordinate, would be the next in line for company leadership. Questioning her could give him some more perspective. \n\nHe found her sitting in her office, fiddling with a set of keys. He couldn't help but notice she was surrounded by a collection of pens from various meets, a quirk that was both peculiar and endearing. However, his keen eye was caught by a hair tie that was nestled amongst the pens. \n\n\"You pick that up recently?\" He chimed, nodding towards the hair tie. Caught off guard, she nodded, \"Yes, it was on the floor in the office.\" Winston just nodded, filing that information away for later. \n\nDiving into their conversation, Paige admitted that Iris was a dedicated boss, refusing to cut staff numbers and that she kept investing in unsuccessful projects, much to the chagrin of others. Paige admitted to knowing about the company's deteriorating health, given Iris's stubborn management methods, yet, she seemed thoroughly sad about her boss's demise.\n\nJust then, one of Paige's employees entered, looking flustered. \"I found something weird,\" she said, showing Winston something that looked like a keyhole behind a movable panel in Paige’s desk... a stark contrast to the otherwise meticulous space around them. His curiosity piqued, Winston thanked them and left with a promise for further communication. \n\nWalking around the company's parking lot, he noticed Iris's car often in the frame of the CCTV footage. A coworker who was pulling out of the lot told Winston about seeing Iris the night she died.\n\n\"Saw her going into that meeting with Paige; she looked real tense, \" the coworker indicated a glass cabin that evidently served as the meeting room.\n\nWinston decided to question Paige further. \"Do you have a key to Iris's car by any chance?\" A flicker of surprise flashed across Paige's face as she answered, \"Yes, I do.

Thank you for your time, Ma'am,\" he assured her before making his way back to his car.\n\nWinston flicked through the paperwork once more, using the dull humming coming from the precinct to focus his thoughts. In front of him, there was a landscape photo featuring Alicia in action, surrounded by a sea of flower crowns and women in long dresses. She was a wedding planner, overseeing all the details, including the transportation.\n\nHe looked deeper into the photo and noticed an electronic store across the street, where a store associate had reported Alicia making a purchase. Winston remembered speaking to that associate, who confirmed Alicia bought a stun gun there. This was a store that also sold stun guns, which had recently been purchased by Alicia. It confirmed what he was told, she did work in such a shop part-time. \n\nWinston glanced out his window, thinking pensive thoughts. The wedding required Iris’s car. It was Alicia’s job to ensure the car was used appropriately during the grand event. It certainly was a grand event, and it was a big payday for Alicia’s business.\n\n“Detective Winston, we have new documents for you.” An officer placed a file on his desk with a 'thump'. Financial statements. Alicia’s business wasn’t doing well. In fact, it was operating at a loss.\n\nHeaving a sigh, Winston packed the files into his case. He made his way to Alicia’s apartment.

Nontraditional lenders... not an ideal situation to be in.\n\nStepping outside, Winston lit a cigarette, his hand steady, but mind racing.

The lights always seemed brighter after such a grim event. This used to be where Johnny, a legally adopted son of Jay, and Jay himself celebrated New Year's. However, tonight, their anticipated joint celebration was tarnished with tragedy. Jay was meant to accompany his son tonight, as he always did in previous years. Yet, today, the gaiety was marred by the spilt blood of young Johnny.\n\nTaking silent inventory of the night's events, Winston departed Times Square and headed towards the residence of his unsuspecting suspect, Jay. He received curious glances from the neighbors as he passed by. His presence was quite striking given they were accustomed to seeing the irregular delivery trucks from far-flung places, implying Jay's suspected illegal fishery.\n\nReaching Jay's estate, Winston was greeted with a spectacle bizarre yet beautiful. Carefully arranged insects, like war trophies, were displayed for all. The place breathed less like an extermination spot and more like an entomologists’ gallery. In their conversation, Jay fervently talked of insects' idiosyncrasies reminiscing often about his entomology degree he pursued in college. It was a knowledge accumulated over the years, he claimed.\n\nDespite such peculiar oddities, something else caught Winston’s attention. Jay's demeanor exhibited an aura of a grieving father who had just lost his child. Every word, every gesture towards Johnny was drenched in fatherly affection. This he observed as he subtly probed into Jay's Times Square hotel booking from that very night shared over their New Year's plans discussion.\n\nJay confidently produced the confirmation for his hotel reservation, confirming his presence at Times Square, booked for the very night of the murder taking place. He seemed unbothered, almost casual like discussing an ordinary routine, even when Johnny's intention to report his illegal fishery was disclosed. Winston found this revelation stirring. Johnny had confessed to him, and unbelievably, Jay happened to overhear their private conversation revealing Johnny's turn of trust.\n\nThe conversation took a turn towards Jay's unusual hobbies, including the exotic delivery trucks that catered to his needs, and the display cases filled with nicely arranged insects. Jay, light-hearted in his response, flirted with anecdotes trailing from his college days.\n\nThe air was thick with grief as they remembered Johnny. Loaded with information, Winston pieced together a clear perspective of the suspect. Yet the investigation was far from over. Something hung unanswered, unfinished. As Winston exited Jay's house, silence echoed the unspoken truths left to be discovered.\n\nWinston scrutinized the surroundings of Times Square. It was almost surreal that amidst the clamor and hustle, a murder had taken place here, Johnny's murder. The murder weapon was peculiar, a trident.\n\nDespite the city's innumerable faces, battalions of CCTV cameras, incessantly flashing screens surrounding the quadrant, a witness had spotted Karl here.\n\nClearing his throat, Winston began his interrogation. \"You've been spotted here today Karl, can you explain that?\"\n\nThe reply came quick, \"Yeah, I was here, detective. I come here often.\"\n\n\"You and Johnny had an argument?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Karl nodded, then his face grew grave. \"He threatened to go to the police about some documents he'd found. I tried to reason with him,” said Karl, his voice trembling slightly. “But we argued. We argued often. He had a hot temper, and I suspect, mad as hell he was.\"\n\nPeople swarmed around like an ongoing carnival, but Winston kept his gaze unwavered on Karl. \"You have a soft spot for history, don't you?\" Winston ventured.\n\n\"Yeah, I love historical weaponry. I've got a nice collection at home,\" Karl stated somewhat proudly.\n\nWinston knew, his suspicion was correct. The house search had revealed a Trident among Karl's collection of ancient weapons, now confiscated.\n\n\"Interesting,\" he observed. \"Used any of them? For fighting or such.\"\n\n\"Tridents... I took some trident fighting lessons last summer,\" Karl admitted with an awkward laugh.\n\nStrange coincidence, or just an indication of motives, Winston thought. Besides, the trident and Times Square; there was also that heated argument over some documents about his financial misdemeanors.\n\n\"Financial misdemeanors,\" Winston probed.\n\nThe look in Karl's eyes revealed something, but he simply shrugged, \"Stock market’s a tricky business, detective. Johnny didn't fully understand it.\"\n\nWinston thanked him for his time and left. City lights illuminated the square. Karl, now successful in stock manipulation, hoped to remain unseen by the police. But Johnny knew, and had discovered evidence of Karl’s illegal activities.

As Winston exited Jay's house, silence echoed the unspoken truths left to be discovered.\\n\\nWinston scrutinized the surroundings of Times Square. It was almost surreal that amidst the clamor and hustle, a murder had taken place here, Johnny's murder. The murder weapon was peculiar, a trident.\\n\\nDespite the city's innumerable faces, battalions of CCTV cameras, incessantly flashing screens surrounding the quadrant, a witness had spotted Karl here.\\n\\nClearing his throat, Winston began his interrogation. \\\"You've been spotted here today Karl, can you explain that?\\\"\\n\\nThe reply came quick, \\\"Yeah, I was here, detective. I come here often.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You and Johnny had an argument?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" Karl nodded, then his face grew grave. \\\"He threatened to go to the police about some documents he'd found. I tried to reason with him,\\u201d said Karl, his voice trembling slightly. \\u201cBut we argued. We argued often. He had a hot temper, and I suspect, mad as hell he was.\\\"\\n\\nPeople swarmed around like an ongoing carnival, but Winston kept his gaze unwavered on Karl. \\\"You have a soft spot for history, don't you?\\\" Winston ventured.\\n\\n\\\"Yeah, I love historical weaponry. I've got a nice collection at home,\\\" Karl stated somewhat proudly.\\n\\nWinston knew, his suspicion was correct. The house search had revealed a Trident among Karl's collection of ancient weapons, now confiscated.\\n\\n\\\"Interesting,\\\" he observed. \\\"Used any of them? For fighting or such.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tridents... I took some trident fighting lessons last summer,\\\" Karl admitted with an awkward laugh.\\n\\nStrange coincidence, or just an indication of motives, Winston thought. Besides, the trident and Times Square; there was also that heated argument over some documents about his financial misdemeanors.\\n\\n\\\"Financial misdemeanors,\\\" Winston probed.\\n\\nThe look in Karl's eyes revealed something, but he simply shrugged, \\\"Stock market\\u2019s a tricky business, detective. Johnny didn't fully understand it.\\\"\\n\\nWinston thanked him for his time and left. City lights illuminated the square. Karl, now successful in stock manipulation, hoped to remain unseen by the police. But Johnny knew, and had discovered evidence of Karl\\u2019s illegal activities.

The coroner's report indicated Ivan's time of death aligns perfectly with when Timothy, a self-professed herpetology enthusiast with extensive knowledge of acquiring and handling venom from his exotic snakes, had been at the studio. It had only been a few days, but the studio felt hauntingly empty. He turned his gaze to the padded wall, where someone had written, \"Timothy and Ivan, a deadly harmony.\"\n\nIt was here that Winston found a recorded conversation between Ivan and Timothy, where Ivan fiercely confronted Timothy about his secret affair with Ivan's girlfriend. \"You'll have hell to pay,\" Ivan had threatened in the recording. Clearly, Ivan was no longer a mere obstacle for Timothy, but a threat to his secret relationship that he wouldn't afford to get exposed.\n\nBack at headquarters, Winston found himself faced with Timothy in the interrogation room, a lanky lad with a laid-back demeanor of a surfing instructor. \"So, Timothy,\" began Winston trying to cut through the tension. \"You were at the recording studio on the day Ivan died, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah...\" Timothy played with the frayed edge of his board shorts, \"We were working on a music project, you know. I just... I had no idea he was gonna end up... like that.\"\n\n\"And no one else was at the studio then, I assume?\" Winston questioned calmly. Timothy merely nodded, his gaze fixed on the plain metal table between them.\n\nWinston pursued, \"I heard... something about Ivan confronting you about your secret affair with his girlfriend. That'd make anyone pretty jealous. And then you'd be afraid Ivan would reveal your secret, right?\" Silence followed as Timothy clenched his jaw tightly, hands nervously tightening into fists. His jealousy was evident, as was his fear of Ivan revealing their secret relationship.\n\nLater that day, Winston found himself wandering down to a strange, exotic animal shop in the city. The shopkeeper, a wiry man with spectacles, recognized Timothy from a photograph. Timothy frequented the place, purchasing his exotic snakes from here - not just for their beauty but also for the lethal venom some of them could produce.\n\n\"They're beautiful creatures,\" the shopkeeper remarked, \"Can be really dangerous though. Timothy knows that. He spends hours studying them and knows exactly how to handle them and their venom.\"\n\nWinston nodded, thoughts racing in his mind. The timeline was starting to line up... Ivan confronted Timothy about his affair with his girlfriend, resulting in Timothy becoming jealous. With his advanced knowledge of venom and snakes, Timothy could have easily silenced Ivan forever. As he walked out of the store, Winston looked back at the snakes. Their eyes gleamed ominously under the warm lights, a dangerous secret they shared with their owner.\n\nDetective Winston stared at the envelope in his hands. It contained a recording of a man's voice... Ricky's voice. Ricky had confessed to engaging in illegal activities at the pet shop he owned during a one-on-one meeting with Ivan, an incriminating evidence towards Ricky. Ivan, Ricky's employee, had managed to record this meeting and now was using it to blackmail his boss. Ivan was the sole possessor of such damning evidence against Ricky. The envelope addressed to Ivan had been found amongst the many other envelopes from anonymous senders that overloaded Ricky's mail box daily. Winston sighed, mentally checking off the initial facts.\n\nStepping inside the pet shop, Winston noted Ricky, the man who was visibly apprehensive. He was holding onto something, something that spelled danger. Ricky owned a venomous snake- his trusted companion. Winston's eyes narrowed visibly, remembering Ricky's well-versed knowledge of venom extraction. But right now, his attention was more focused on the legal documents that lay strewn about the table. The pet shop was in his name, and the blackmail was threatening ruin, both financially and legally.\n\nSuddenly, Ricky moved. He pulled open a drawer bursting with wigs, glasses, and an assortment of props. Instantly, Winston recalled the photograph he received from a witness, who had spotted Ricky at a passport photo shop. The picture showed Ricky surrounded by various props, similar to the ones he now held in his hands. Ricky seemed to be prepared for every eventuality, but why? Winston kept his thoughts to himself, focusing on the task at hand.\n\nRicky moved around the room, apparently agitated. Winston asked him mundane questions, like how his day had been, what his work involved. Ricky, nervous though he was, responded readily. Soon, minutes turned into hours as the detective–suspect duo sat locked in an interrogation that was as much unspoken as spoken. The room still held the echo of Ivan's lethal poisoning, and with each word uttered, Ricky painted a complex canvas; a canvas depicting a secretive life of illegal activities, desperate actions, and an existence losing coherence amidst the deceit.\n\nWinston knew, the mystery was far from solved. There were still layers to Ricky that needed to be peeled back. He knew he had a tough task ahead with numerous clues left to be discovered. As he exited the pet shop door, he bade farewell to a day filled with questioning and welcomed an impending journey of uncloaking the truth.", "question": "Who is the most likely murderer?", "choices": "['Timothy', 'Ricky']", "answer_index": 0, "answer_choice": "Timothy"}, "target": "(`)", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": ["[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please answer the following question with (a), (b), (c), (d) \\n\\nInside the buzzing hubbub of the city's most popular recording studio, Ivan's death by snake venom sends shockwaves through the music realm, forcing the indomitable Detective Winston to pierce the veil of sound and silence, suspects, Timothy and Ricky, echoing in his ears.\\n\\nThe buzzing audio equipment of the recording studio filled the eerie silence as Winston took in the place where Ivan's life had tragically ended.

Timothy frequented the place, purchasing his exotic snakes from here - not just for their beauty but also for the lethal venom some of them could produce.\\n\\n\\\"They're beautiful creatures,\\\" the shopkeeper remarked, \\\"Can be really dangerous though. Timothy knows that. He spends hours studying them and knows exactly how to handle them and their venom.\\\"\\n\\nWinston nodded, thoughts racing in his mind. The timeline was starting to line up... Ivan confronted Timothy about his affair with his girlfriend, resulting in Timothy becoming jealous. With his advanced knowledge of venom and snakes, Timothy could have easily silenced Ivan forever. As he walked out of the store, Winston looked back at the snakes. Their eyes gleamed ominously under the warm lights, a dangerous secret they shared with their owner.\\n\\nDetective Winston stared at the envelope in his hands. It contained a recording of a man's voice... Ricky's voice. Ricky had confessed to engaging in illegal activities at the pet shop he owned during a one-on-one meeting with Ivan, an incriminating evidence towards Ricky. Ivan, Ricky's employee, had managed to record this meeting and now was using it to blackmail his boss. Ivan was the sole possessor of such damning evidence against Ricky. The envelope addressed to Ivan had been found amongst the many other envelopes from anonymous senders that overloaded Ricky's mail box daily. Winston sighed, mentally checking off the initial facts.\\n\\nStepping inside the pet shop, Winston noted Ricky, the man who was visibly apprehensive. He was holding onto something, something that spelled danger. Ricky owned a venomous snake- his trusted companion. Winston's eyes narrowed visibly, remembering Ricky's well-versed knowledge of venom extraction. But right now, his attention was more focused on the legal documents that lay strewn about the table. The pet shop was in his name, and the blackmail was threatening ruin, both financially and legally.\\n\\nSuddenly, Ricky moved. He pulled open a drawer bursting with wigs, glasses, and an assortment of props. Instantly, Winston recalled the photograph he received from a witness, who had spotted Ricky at a passport photo shop. The picture showed Ricky surrounded by various props, similar to the ones he now held in his hands. Ricky seemed to be prepared for every eventuality, but why? Winston kept his thoughts to himself, focusing on the task at hand.\\n\\nRicky moved around the room, apparently agitated. Winston asked him mundane questions, like how his day had been, what his work involved. Ricky, nervous though he was, responded readily. Soon, minutes turned into hours as the detective\\u2013suspect duo sat locked in an interrogation that was as much unspoken as spoken. The room still held the echo of Ivan's lethal poisoning, and with each word uttered, Ricky painted a complex canvas; a canvas depicting a secretive life of illegal activities, desperate actions, and an existence losing coherence amidst the deceit.\\n\\nWinston knew, the mystery was far from solved. There were still layers to Ricky that needed to be peeled back. He knew he had a tough task ahead with numerous clues left to be discovered. As he exited the pet shop door, he bade farewell to a day filled with questioning and welcomed an impending journey of uncloaking the truth.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Timothy\\n(b) - Ricky\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(a) - Timothy"]], "filtered_resps": ["(a)"], "doc_hash": "7f1bdf5e78d25c72b3c756c4273c890862c89db672db0a84ad23f66ce111ce00", "prompt_hash": "27405051842e8a8cdede9b9de307d758263f7d6b470fc32236b5cb69ede90c5d", "target_hash": "e300f251dc09073a9781733cd99758d04a98290157b77fb5c4a986b123900fc6", "exact_match": 0.0}

Highlighted information spelled out a sad tale of love, jealousy, and secrets; especially the ones contained in Timothy's silent confession of an argument where Ivan confronted him about the affair with his girlfriend.\n\nAs he entered the studio, a peculiar detail stood out – it was empty when the victim was found. The police had taken the usual preliminary measures, clearing the premises as they went. That detail played a repetitive note in Winston's mind. There was only one name that matched the time of death, Timothy.\n\nBegrudgingly, he agreed to interview Timothy, the victim’s friend and also a surfing instructor by trade. Timothy's van was a shrine to waxed boards of all sizes, shapes, and colors, almost like weapons of battle against the waves. When Winston had asked him about it, Timothy fondly explained that every board had its unique purpose, for each wave and beach condition. His job demanded him to know places, waves, and beaches in intimate detail. One could even notice the envy tinged bitterness in Timothy's voice when he shared his love for discovering new surfing spots and how Ivan’s musical success overshadowed his own aspirations.\n\n“What brings you here, detective?” Timothy's voice cut through Winston's thoughts. “Well, you were last seen here with Ivan. You guys…\"\n\n“Yeah, we were working on a music project together,” Timothy finished Winston's half-spoken question. His face turned a shade darker as he added, “That was our thing, you know. He did the music, I brought the vibe. But everyone always loved Ivan more, even my own girlfriend.”\n\nThere was a certain restlessness in Timothy's manner.

Most of all, there was a looming fear of Ivan revealing their secret affair to the world.\n\nWinston slowly stood up, giving Timothy a knowing look. He thanked him for his time and walked away, leaving an unsettling silence behind him as Timothy sat, staring at the spot where Ivan used to create music.

Jamal's empty chair, a token of a dangerous gamble. Too high of a stake, with a godchild as your appointed dealer.\n\n\"Lillian, was it?\" Winston began, attempting to keep his tone as neutral as possible. The woman before him, a young biologist specializing in amphibians, nodded as she squirmed slightly under his gaze.\n\n\"Jamal spoke highly of you,\" he said, casting an eye towards her drink. She gulped, but stayed silent.\n\n\"He trusted you,\" Winston continued, surveying the crime scene with his trained eye. \"Even was seen taking a sip from your very drink there.\"\n\nLillian straightened in her chair. \"Always giving him advice,\" Winston mused, a thought dancing at the edge of his vision. \"And always willing to try something new.\"\n\nIt wasn't hard to guess that Lillian had always desired more. The lust for power hung around her like an exotic perfume, intoxicating to those in her proximity. She wanted to be Jamal. Jamal, the casino mogul; his elusive empire tantalizingly within reach.\n\nOutside, the neon lights of the casino blinked erratically, casting an eerie greenish hue over the scene. A darting shadow caught Winston's attention - a strange silhouette of a rare species of frog in a glass tank, well-known amongst biologists for its lethal toxins, shimmered in the glow. An interesting pet for a woman so consumed with desire.\n\n\"Lillian, you're a herpetologist, we gather?\" Winston questioned, inclining his head towards the amphibian. She nodded, a glint appearing in her eyes. \"And you've been studying the toxins of this frog for years...\"\n\nDismissing Lillian, Winston surveyed the casino once more. It was a den of decadence, a palace of transient prosperity run by Jamal, the giver of fortunes, who had no other known kin but a science-smitten child drawn to the perilous allure of her amphibian pets.\n\nOne clear fact remained.

There they were, tucked into the high stake section; Kimberly, a picture-perfect shuffle of a grandma, and Jamal, joyfully throwing himself into the game with wild abandon.\n\n\"Yes,\" the manager confirmed for him. \"That’s Kimberly. Her card records place her at the same table as Jamal that night. She didn't leave until the medics arrived for him.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston replied, still not looking up from the phone.\n\nThe detective continued his rounds, shuffling further into the labyrinth of the casino. Finally, he found the bar. He nodded at the barman, an inquisitive look in his eyes. \"Kimberly brought Jamal a drink that night, didn’t she?\"\n\nThe barman swiped at an imaginary spill as he raised an eyebrow at Winston. \"Yeah, she did.

Geological, biological, a vast array of topics. But one caught his eye; a detailed study on various poisons, including how much was lethal. Of particular interest was one paper detailing the extraction methods for poison from a highly dangerous frog species.\n\nFlipping through her mail, each letter addressed to a unique mailing address, one for each city Kimberly had grandchildren.

{"doc_id": 43, "doc": {"narrative": "In the glitzy, high-stakes world of casinos, Jamal meets a deadly end by frog poison, leaving Detective Winston to weave through a web of deceit with two prime suspects - Kimberly and Lillian.\n\nWinston took a moment to steady his thoughts as he pushed through the bustling casino crowd and headed towards the high stakes tables, where the Kurten family, a notable name in the city that Kimberly Kurten was always so intensely proud of, often gathered.\n\nIn his possession, he had copies of the casino’s surveillance footage, which clearly showed Kimberly not leaving the casino until after the events of the tragic night had unraveled. It was indeed an unusual evening, where he had gained knowledge that Jamal was about to reveal his secret gambling problem, a scandal that could have undoubtedly ruined the reputation of the Kurten family, before his tragic death ended those plans untimely.\n\nWinston found Kimberly, Jamal's grandmother, sitting sullenly with a spent slot machine, her eyes tired and glassy. She was always a lady of resolve, and her attire tonight attested her character. The familiar cigarette smoke-infused air around her gave gravity to the situation.\n\n\"We heard you've been interested in studying unique frog species,\" Winston started tentatively, referencing her recent purchase of a rare and highly poisonous frog, without failing to mention about the documents found in her home, which not only discussed extracting venom from the said species but also comprehensively detailed physical effects of the frog's lethal doses,\n\n\"Yes,\" Kimberly admitted. \"It's quite a fascinating hobby that I've picked up.\"\n\n\"Do you know the frog you own can be highly lethal?\" Winston probed, watching her reaction closely.\n\n\"Well, I am aware. In fact, I've read all about it, and that formed a substantial part of my research, especially investigating the effects of its venom,\" said Kimberly, revealing her ongoing project for the first time.\n\nNodding, Winston changed the subject. \"You were with Jamal here at the casino, the night he tragically died, correct?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said softly, her voice barely audible over the chorus of slot machines and croupier calls. \"We both came here together.\"\n\n\"On the surveillance footage, it appears you brought Jamal his favorite drink that night. Barely a few moments after he had it, he collapsed.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's correct, Detective Winston,\" Kimberly confirmed, her gaze fixed somewhere distant, \"He wasn't feeling well all evening. I've always been worried about his reckless gambling, and the impact it would have on our standing in society, not to mention the ruin it would have brought upon us if he had his way.\"\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, Winston rose to excuse himself, leaving Kimberly dwelling in the harsh neon lights, weighed down by a grandmother's sorrow. Despite the clamoring commotion around him, Winston found an eerie silence; a tragic tale of love, concern, and reputation had unraveled that night.\n\nSitting in his criminally underlit office, Detective Winston pored over the case files for Jamal's murder. His brow furrowed at the cause of death - a lethal frog poison.

It was indeed an unusual evening, where he had gained knowledge that Jamal was about to reveal his secret gambling problem, a scandal that could have undoubtedly ruined the reputation of the Kurten family, before his tragic death ended those plans untimely.\\n\\nWinston found Kimberly, Jamal's grandmother, sitting sullenly with a spent slot machine, her eyes tired and glassy. She was always a lady of resolve, and her attire tonight attested her character. The familiar cigarette smoke-infused air around her gave gravity to the situation.\\n\\n\\\"We heard you've been interested in studying unique frog species,\\\" Winston started tentatively, referencing her recent purchase of a rare and highly poisonous frog, without failing to mention about the documents found in her home, which not only discussed extracting venom from the said species but also comprehensively detailed physical effects of the frog's lethal doses,\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" Kimberly admitted. \\\"It's quite a fascinating hobby that I've picked up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you know the frog you own can be highly lethal?\\\" Winston probed, watching her reaction closely.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I am aware.

I've always been worried about his reckless gambling, and the impact it would have on our standing in society, not to mention the ruin it would have brought upon us if he had his way.\\\"\\n\\nAfter a few moments of silence, Winston rose to excuse himself, leaving Kimberly dwelling in the harsh neon lights, weighed down by a grandmother's sorrow. Despite the clamoring commotion around him, Winston found an eerie silence; a tragic tale of love, concern, and reputation had unraveled that night.\\n\\nSitting in his criminally underlit office, Detective Winston pored over the case files for Jamal's murder.

He rewound to the point where he noticed Lucy leave the fitness center. The time stamp showed 15 minutes after the coroner's estimated time of death of Tommy, the unfortunate victim.\n\nEarlier in the day, Winston had come across an interesting note in the primary investigations. Tommy had been receiving payments from Lucy, presumably to keep some secret that Lucy had unwittingly divulged. Tommy, however, had made known that it wasn't enough... that she needed to pay him a larger sum... a sum she wasn't able to produce.\n\nThis reality led Winston to pay some attention to Lucy. It turned out, Lucy, a known dancer, had an upcoming practice at the same fitness center on the fateful day of Tommy's demise. Lucy's dance was quite unique--she danced with a shiv, not just as a prop, but as an integral part of her performance, spinning, slashing, and twirling it around.\n\nWinston decided to visit the fitness center and found Lucy's signature in the sign-in sheet, marked at the same exact time as Tommy's estimated time of death. The receptionist chipped in, \"Lucy entered here with Tommy that day... this was actually the first time I'd seen them together.\" This suggested that Lucy had no choice but to confront Tommy in an attempt to stop his blackmailing.\n\nThe revelation about Lucy's professional life and her peculiar dance performances stunned him. The receptionist said, “If her secret was ever exposed, Lucy's career would end disastrously. As for her dance, her use of the shiv as part of her show is quite an expected sight.”\n\nMoreover, Winston discovered a faded, grubby envelope in Tommy’s gym locker.

{"doc_id": 48, "doc": {"narrative": "When fitness enthusiast Rufus was found dead from a hunting knife wound at his local gym, it's up to seasoned Detective Winston to interview top suspects Harvey and Sergio in a baffling murder mystery.\n\nWinston rubbed his temples in frustration as he stared at the cold file in front of him, the file of Rufus. The fitness fanatic who'd apparently taken one too many steps on the treadmill. Murdered in his safe haven of a fitness center, of all places. The murder weapon: a hunting knife, savage and oddly out of place in the sterile, health-centered environment. The time of the unfortunate event was firmly during Harvey's regular workout slot.\n\nHe let out a slow breath and maneuvered his way to the very center of his investigation. The one man who seemed to be the focus of this swirl of confusion: Harvey. \n\nWinston located Harvey at the same fitness center, engaged in a heavy workout regime. Harvey was an astronaut, disciplined and rigorously trained, his steely determination ever evident. His expression was of hard-angled concentration as he executed his exercises with habitual precision. \n\n\"Seems like you never miss a day, eh, Harvey?\" Winston called out to him, keeping his tone casual. Harvey stopped his workout and turned, his face momentarily losing its studied calm as he registered Rufus' name.\n\n\"I...I like keeping a routine,\" Harvey responded, visibly uncomfortable. \"You remember, uh, Rufus? Used to workout same time as me, if I remember correctly.\" Harvey's reply was a forced chuckle, but his eyes were stormy and distant.\n\nThen Winston dropped a serious bombshell,  “You know, I spoke to Jake the other day. He tells me you told him Rufus had some dirt on you? Something about blackmail?” Harvey flinched at this mention leaving Winston confident that Jake’s words held a nugget of truth.\n\nWinston leaned against a workout machine, trying to keep the conversation relaxed. Though he served in outer space, Harvey seemed quite grounded to the fitness center. The astronaut in him always brought him back. It was part of their training, everyone knew that astronauts were masters of more than just astrophysics. Their physical training regime could put the best athletes to shame.\n\nIn the stream of fitness enthusiasts, Harvey was often an island, preferring to workout alone. Winston observed his familiarity with sharp objects from afar, courtesy of his astronaut training perhaps.\n\n\"Got a new combat routine, I see,\" Winston observed, pointing out Harvey's well-practiced form with a knife.\n\n\"Needed to practice, Detective,\" Harvey confirmed, showing Winston the knife. \"You never know when you might need it up there...in space.\"\n\nBringing up Rufus was like pressing a trigger. Harvey's face visibly lost color at Rufus' mention, his icy-controlled demeanor cracking slightly. \n\n\"Yeah, Rufus...\" He sighed, \"He had some stuff on me.. I mean rumor has it, but... he wouldn't do that to me, you know?\" As fatigue set into his voice, Winston noticed the distress behind Harvey's seemingly simple words. \n\nBarreling down, Winston remembered a casual tidbit he'd picked up recently. \"Hunting like your old man now, Harvey?\" \n\nHarvey hesitated before answering, \"Yeah, got my own now,\" he said, showcasing the knife again.\n\nAs Winston watched Harvey resume his solitary workout, the pieces of the puzzle slowly aligned in his mind. He wasn't there yet, but the investigation had certainly taken an interesting new twist. \n\n\"Keep in touch, Harvey,\" Winston called, leaving the man to his thoughts and his workout routine that seemed to be solitary for more reasons than one.\n\nDetective Winston surveyed the scene: a fitness center turned into a crime scene. Rufus, a regular client at the center, was the unfortunate victim. As he collected evidence, he recalled a pertinent detail: Rufus had a scheduled massage appointment on the day of his demise.\n\nWinston turned his attention to the masseur, Sergio. It struck him as peculiar that Sergio was relatively detached from his coworkers. He kept to his routine, arriving, completing his appointments, and leaving without mingling. \n\nSergio's professional commitment was admirable. His clientele had mentioned his silence during the sessions, focusing intently on his work. The private massage rooms, secluded and soundproof, added an extra degree of professionalism to his services.\n\nMoving past the massage room, he darted his gaze towards Rufus's wife, who stood to the side, nervously fiddling with her fingers. Winston remembered the rumors surrounding her. She had been allegedly lying about her whereabouts, a fact Rufus had confronted her about. \n\nWinston couldn't help but observe the notable chemistry between Sergio and her. They seemed to engage frequently, often spotted together, and spent seemingly endless hours alone despite Sergio's introvert nature. Her phone records held another quirk: Sergio's name appeared excessively.\n\nFinally, he strolled over to Sergio who stood silent and distant from the crowd. Even when spoken to, he was a man of few words. Winston had to admire the cryptic façade Sergio managed to maintain, never revealing any personal aspect of his life. \n\nA bell chimed, awakening Winston from his musings, indicating the end of an intense workout class nearby.

The fitness fanatic who'd apparently taken one too many steps on the treadmill. Murdered in his safe haven of a fitness center, of all places. The murder weapon: a hunting knife, savage and oddly out of place in the sterile, health-centered environment. The time of the unfortunate event was firmly during Harvey's regular workout slot.\\n\\nHe let out a slow breath and maneuvered his way to the very center of his investigation. The one man who seemed to be the focus of this swirl of confusion: Harvey. \\n\\nWinston located Harvey at the same fitness center, engaged in a heavy workout regime. Harvey was an astronaut, disciplined and rigorously trained, his steely determination ever evident. His expression was of hard-angled concentration as he executed his exercises with habitual precision. \\n\\n\\\"Seems like you never miss a day, eh, Harvey?\\\" Winston called out to him, keeping his tone casual. Harvey stopped his workout and turned, his face momentarily losing its studied calm as he registered Rufus' name.\\n\\n\\\"I...I like keeping a routine,\\\" Harvey responded, visibly uncomfortable. \\\"You remember, uh, Rufus? Used to workout same time as me, if I remember correctly.\\\" Harvey's reply was a forced chuckle, but his eyes were stormy and distant.\\n\\nThen Winston dropped a serious bombshell,  \\u201cYou know, I spoke to Jake the other day. He tells me you told him Rufus had some dirt on you? Something about blackmail?\\u201d Harvey flinched at this mention leaving Winston confident that Jake\\u2019s words held a nugget of truth.\\n\\nWinston leaned against a workout machine, trying to keep the conversation relaxed. Though he served in outer space, Harvey seemed quite grounded to the fitness center. The astronaut in him always brought him back. It was part of their training, everyone knew that astronauts were masters of more than just astrophysics. Their physical training regime could put the best athletes to shame.\\n\\nIn the stream of fitness enthusiasts, Harvey was often an island, preferring to workout alone. Winston observed his familiarity with sharp objects from afar, courtesy of his astronaut training perhaps.\\n\\n\\\"Got a new combat routine, I see,\\\" Winston observed, pointing out Harvey's well-practiced form with a knife.\\n\\n\\\"Needed to practice, Detective,\\\" Harvey confirmed, showing Winston the knife. \\\"You never know when you might need it up there...in space.\\\"\\n\\nBringing up Rufus was like pressing a trigger. Harvey's face visibly lost color at Rufus' mention, his icy-controlled demeanor cracking slightly. \\n\\n\\\"Yeah, Rufus...\\\" He sighed, \\\"He had some stuff on me.. I mean rumor has it, but... he wouldn't do that to me, you know?\\\" As fatigue set into his voice, Winston noticed the distress behind Harvey's seemingly simple words. \\n\\nBarreling down, Winston remembered a casual tidbit he'd picked up recently. \\\"Hunting like your old man now, Harvey?\\\" \\n\\nHarvey hesitated before answering, \\\"Yeah, got my own now,\\\" he said, showcasing the knife again.\\n\\nAs Winston watched Harvey resume his solitary workout, the pieces of the puzzle slowly aligned in his mind. He wasn't there yet, but the investigation had certainly taken an interesting new twist. \\n\\n\\\"Keep in touch, Harvey,\\\" Winston called, leaving the man to his thoughts and his workout routine that seemed to be solitary for more reasons than one.\\n\\nDetective Winston surveyed the scene: a fitness center turned into a crime scene. Rufus, a regular client at the center, was the unfortunate victim. As he collected evidence, he recalled a pertinent detail: Rufus had a scheduled massage appointment on the day of his demise.\\n\\nWinston turned his attention to the masseur, Sergio. It struck him as peculiar that Sergio was relatively detached from his coworkers. He kept to his routine, arriving, completing his appointments, and leaving without mingling. \\n\\nSergio's professional commitment was admirable. His clientele had mentioned his silence during the sessions, focusing intently on his work. The private massage rooms, secluded and soundproof, added an extra degree of professionalism to his services.\\n\\nMoving past the massage room, he darted his gaze towards Rufus's wife, who stood to the side, nervously fiddling with her fingers. Winston remembered the rumors surrounding her. She had been allegedly lying about her whereabouts, a fact Rufus had confronted her about. \\n\\nWinston couldn't help but observe the notable chemistry between Sergio and her. They seemed to engage frequently, often spotted together, and spent seemingly endless hours alone despite Sergio's introvert nature. Her phone records held another quirk: Sergio's name appeared excessively.\\n\\nFinally, he strolled over to Sergio who stood silent and distant from the crowd. Even when spoken to, he was a man of few words. Winston had to admire the cryptic fa\\u00e7ade Sergio managed to maintain, never revealing any personal aspect of his life. \\n\\nA bell chimed, awakening Winston from his musings, indicating the end of an intense workout class nearby. Rufus had a standard fitness regimen, Winston mused, which Sergio was no doubt aware of. He found it fascinating how everything tied together somehow - the isolation, the silence, the silent communication.

The day had been anything but a usual one and he reviewed the paper on his clipboard yet again. Kaylee, a young woman, was found dead in an abandoned factory of all places and the purported weapon was a pickaxe, an old miner's pickaxe to be exact.\n\nHis next interview was scheduled with a nanny named Penelope. Penelope was not your average nanny. Alongside her formal education in early child care, she also had professional training in the same field, acquiring skills that allowed her to excel in handling children. Despite her credible qualifications, Winston found it decidedly strange to connect a nanny with such a gruesome find, not least because Penelope herself had most of her busy day spent with children, not in an old factory.\n\nAfter a short walk, he approached a modest suburban home quite close to the abandoned factory. The home itself, despite its proximity, seemed worlds apart from the grim discovery location. \n\nPenelope greeted him at the door, shaking his hand with a warm smile. \"Hello, Penelope.\" Winston greeted, then a thought hit him. A person of her profession is typically responsible for a child's growth and upbringing. Penelope's studied and trained background in childcare had indeed stuck in his mind since their last encounter.\n\nDuring their conversation, Winston learned that Penelope was seen leaving her house around the estimated time of the murder. Interestingly enough, he even had a witness claiming to see Penelope with an old mining pickaxe earlier that day, a claim solidly backed up as the recovered pickaxe, the very same weapon used in the murder, matched exactly the one described by the witness.\n\nJust as he was thinking about the pickaxe, a piece of evidence from the crime scene flashed across his mind. Winston reached into his jacket pocket to pull out a page from a diary. It was from Kaylee's diary. The entry was clear; Kaylee had a meeting scheduled with Penelope at the so-called abandoned factory.\n\nA unease washed over Winston, making the usually delicious coffee taste sour in his mouth. Kaylee seemed to have known something about Penelope that she didn't want public. She had unearthed something about Penelope's past... maybe even criminal past. The parents didn't know... and Kaylee was planning to tell.\n\nHe glanced at Penelope, who was sitting across from him, looking anxious. She must've known that the exposure would cause her serious embarrassment... and at worst, cost her her job. With no other events reported that could have prevented Kaylee from meeting Penelope, it all looped back to the meeting at the factory.\n\n\"Well, Penelope, I do have a long walk back to my car.\" he said, finishing the last of his coffee and standing up. \"I've taken enough of your time, thank you for your cooperation.\" He gave a nod as he reached the door, leaving the nanny to contemplate her day filled with children, and his with unanswered questions.\n\nDetective Winston grimaced, finally setting down the carefully documented police case file of the late Kaylee. The coffee stains on the file folder began to bleed into the corners of the cover. The pangs of guilt for indulging in too much work in the form of an overbrewed cup of joe were not his only concern. An image haunted him; it was from a video footage where Francis had caught Kaylee red-handed, threatening his daughter which he digitally recorded as proof.\n\nShaking the sudden chill from his spine, Winston looked out of his office window to the abandoned factory where Kaylee had been found. Francis, Kaylee's husband, had years of mining experience and was renowned for his pickaxe expertise. Francis had arranged the meeting point and was seen coaxing her into trusting that the factory would be undisturbed.\n\nThe town had all been abuzz with this unthinkable murder. Kaylee's constant torment of Francis' daughter, enough to induce anxiety and depression in the child, was now common knowledge. Even more upsetting was the unusual delicateness Francis had shown in handling this situation, a man known for his work involving grueling physical labor that required a high level of strength and endurance.\n\nDigging into his pocket Winston pulled out the receipt for the pickaxe that he'd found in Francis’ pocket, a peculiar coincidence considering Francis’ mining background and the tool associated with it.\n\nIn the corner of his foul-smelling, second-hand leather bound desk was a photograph. A crisp, clear frame showing Francis purchasing the said pickaxe at the local hardware store. It was not surprising that Francis had chosen to arm himself with a tool he was already so familiar with, but to invite his wife into a murderous trap of his creation was another level of distressing reality.\n\nWinston looked up to see Francis standing in the doorway, tall and solemn. \"Detective Winston,\" he said quietly, \"We need to talk about Kaylee.\"\n\nWinston nodded, gesturing for him to take a seat. \"I heard about what happened. About the threats she made to your daughter.\"\n\nFrancis looked taken aback, his gaze shifting around the room. \"Yes...I caught her threatening our daughter. I don't know why she couldn't see what her actions were doing to our daughter.\"\n\nWinston nodded but said nothing. He stayed silent, letting Francis explain in his own time, about the factory meeting he'd arranged with Kaylee, his knowledge that the factory would have been empty at that time, the purchased pickaxe and the chilling threats Kaylee had aimed towards his daughter.\n\nAs Francis left his office, Winston glanced back at the file, picking up the coffee cup, he pondered the gritty mysteries life tended to serve up.", "question": "Who is the most likely murderer?", "choices": "['Penelope', 'Francis']", "answer_index": 1, "answer_choice": "Francis"}, "target": "(a)", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": ["[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please answer the following question with (a), (b), (c), (d) \\n\\nIn the dim light of an abandoned factory, Kaylee's lifeless body lay with the cold steel of a pickaxe lodged within, thrusting Detective Winston into a dark game of deception with suspects Penelope and Francis.\\n\\nWinston breathed a sigh of relief as he entered the comfort of his car, escaping the oppressive heat outside. The day had been anything but a usual one and he reviewed the paper on his clipboard yet again. Kaylee, a young woman, was found dead in an abandoned factory of all places and the purported weapon was a pickaxe, an old miner's pickaxe to be exact.\\n\\nHis next interview was scheduled with a nanny named Penelope. Penelope was not your average nanny. Alongside her formal education in early child care, she also had professional training in the same field, acquiring skills that allowed her to excel in handling children. Despite her credible qualifications, Winston found it decidedly strange to connect a nanny with such a gruesome find, not least because Penelope herself had most of her busy day spent with children, not in an old factory.\\n\\nAfter a short walk, he approached a modest suburban home quite close to the abandoned factory. The home itself, despite its proximity, seemed worlds apart from the grim discovery location. \\n\\nPenelope greeted him at the door, shaking his hand with a warm smile. \\\"Hello, Penelope.\\\" Winston greeted, then a thought hit him.

He absently flipped through the case file of Uma, somehow the atmosphere matching the mournful story he was reading.\n\nAccording to the notes, Uma was a trainer and part-time script consultant at the same fitness center where Irving, the suspect, also trained. Both typically scheduled their workouts late in the evening, customarily ending when the gym was mostly vacant. The evening Uma met her untimely demise, irrefutable evidence shows Irving stayed later than she did, apparently relishing the solitude. The stark lighting of the closed gym only added to the chilly atmosphere.\n\nWinston carefully sipped his coffee, the bitter taste pulling him from his reverie. Grabbing his notepad, he jotted down a few points to discuss with Irving. Apart from his regular gym routine, various aspects of his writing career were catching Winston's eye.\n\nIrving was known for his precise work on scripts, specifically for his detailed research into harmful substances, even down to their handling and utilization.

It was a short drive, the buildings looming against the gloomy sky forebodingly, each window alight as though the eyes of some unseen spectators.\n\nAs he approached the building, he recalled a report of Irving carrying a vial from his car to his apartment. The vial itself seemed ordinary but combined with his previous online purchases of corrosive substances from a store, it painted a grim picture.\n\nUpon reaching the apartment, his observational skills kicked in, the detective noting the absence of lights; Irving had not yet returned home. His mind wandered back to the fitness center, and the reports claiming that Irving usually stayed late rang even truer considering the current time.\n\n\"Hey, Winston,\" barked a voice over the phone, pulling him back to reality. \n\n\"Irving went home, got caught in the morning traffic.

Yeah, it was the car,\" the officer on the other line chuckled before he hung up.\n\nWinston leaned against the chilling wall, thoughts whirling around in his mind, the proverbially web becoming denser with each passing moment. Irving had a lot to answer for, and that included what happened the tragic night Uma was murdered.\n\nWinston had been to countless crime scenes before, seen unimaginable horrors, yet the fitness center was an unusual one. Uma, one of the well-known fitness enthusiasts had died an inexplicable death. While the cause of her demise was a vial of some sort of acid, the question of 'who?' lingered. He got to work, starting with the first person on his suspect list - Addison, Uma's trainer.\n\nAddison was a common sight at the fitness center, employed as a personal trainer. He always had a smile for everyone, but today, his face held a grimace. \"Not the best day, huh?\" Winston began, attempting to ease into the conversation. \n\nAddison shrugged, his customary smile replaced with a glowering look. Winston pondered silently also absorbing the sight of Addison's custom-made suit. Just a few days ago, Addison had showcased it during a workout demonstration at the fitness center. Quite an unlikely expenditure for a trainer, he thought, especially considering the known fact that Addison was not particularly well paid for his occupation.\n\n\"You remember working with Uma?\" Winston questioned. Addison nodded, confirming that Uma was indeed one of his regular clients. He also mentioned how Uma had once publicly praised his honesty. The irony of the statement was not lost on Winston. There were rumors, after all, that it was Uma who had caught Addison stealing expensive equipment from the gym. \n\n\"Equipment going missing recently?\" The question was straightforward, and Addison's look confirmed the hunch. Addison admitted to the gym's problem with missing expensive equipment, his face darkening considerably. The management had also noticed the problem, apparently. Winston suppressed the urge to connect the dots, to voice his suspicions, but rather, he asked brighter questions. Like if Addison ever needed to travel for work, to which the management and Addison himself confirmed that his job did not entail any work-related travel.\n\nThere was the security footage, of course. Addison entering the gym, nonchalantly, almost cheerfully, shortly before Uma's death. And more importantly, Addison was present in the fitness center at the time of the murder. That was no secret.

Unfortunately, she also stumbled upon some CCTV footage of me taking some expensive equipment. I had intended to return it, it was a mistake. \\\"\\n\\nAs Winston watched the gym members disperse, he looked back at Addison. \\\"So, Uma caught you stealing from the fitness center. That must've been uncomfortable for you. It surfaced in the investigation that fitness equipment has been reported missing recently. Uma seemed to have discovered the theft.\\\"\\n\\nAddison suddenly seemed to find the floor tiles fascinating. \\\"Uma was a good woman,\\\" he said quietly. \\\"It's a shame what happened to her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Agreed,\\\" Winston replied, closing his notebook. \\\"Keep a clear schedule, Addison. We'll be in touch.\\\"\\n\\nAs Winston exited the gym he took one more glance at Addison through the large glass panes.

{"doc_id": 56, "doc": {"narrative": "In a chilling turn of events, Rose is found lifeless in a car, killed by a vial of acid, leading Detective Winston to the affluent suspects, Daisy and Dexter.\n\nWinston was going over the facts of the case when he decided to visit the suspect, Daisy. Daisy wasn't your typical suspect - she was a singer who always had a passion for her art form, a passion that stood in sharp contrast with her family's dismissive attitude.\n\n“I'm just trying to get ahead in life, you know?\" she told Winston as they sat in a small cafe near one of her repeat performance venues - an old building that was frequently harshly criticised for its lack of cleanliness. \"They never cared about my music… always thought it was just a phase. I couldn't stand their lack of support.”\n\nGetting rid of her family members from her contacts was, as she put it, a \"cleansing experience\". It was all very telling of Daisy's meticulous nature - she extended the same cleanliness philosophy to everything in her personal life, hygiene being her top priority; it gave a stark contrast to the venues in which she performed.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, she casually added, \"Sometimes my sarcasm gets the best of me. I can't tell you how many family dinners I've ruined with it. My sarcasm stings so hard, it often leaves them in tears.\"\n\nWinston thought about Rose, who often parked her car in the same vicinity. \"You were scheduled to perform at a place near that parking lot that day… right?\" he asked. Daisy affirmed the fact and mentioned having seen Rose's car, acknowledging that she and Rose were the last two people in the vehicle after her show that night.\n\nAs part of her performances, Daisy often integrated different kinds of acid into her routines - the same kind, as it turned out, that had been used to murder Rose. A cold chill ran down Winston’s spine as he mentally cross-checked the evidence list.\n\n“Acid isn’t a typical instrument for a singer, Daisy...\" Winston quizzed, trying to keep the conversation casual. Daisy just shrugged, \"Got to create a spectacle, right? Attract an audience?”\n\nDaisy had always been adamant about not attending any family gatherings - a fact that did not change even after Rose’s death. But she claimed to hold no ill-will towards Rose. As Winston got up from the table to leave, he turned one final time to look at Daisy who was now alone and engrossed in her phone. A suspect or not, one thing was certain, the story was far from over.\n\nAs Winston sat in his office, he sifted through the photos of the crime scene. The car where Rose had met her gruesome end was familiar to him - it was the one Dexter had sold her just a few days ago. He recalled the witness statement he had received, stating that Dexter and Rose were seen driving off in the new car together on the day of the sale.\n\nA few days prior, he had stopped by the car dealership for a chat with Dexter. The man was always excitable, energetic - the sort of person you'd expect to be selling cars. But beneath that facade, Winston had glimpsed an undertone of tension. A hint of worry, perhaps? He remembered too the bold campaign posters dotting the walls of the showroom - 'Dexter for Office' they proclaimed, his smiling face lit up by the flash of a professional camera. Maintaining a decent public image was crucial for his campaign.\n\n\"Beautiful machine, ain't she?\" Dexter had commented, patting the bonnet of the vehicle with an almost reverential air. His eyes had been bright as he spoke, \"Takes skill to appreciate such precision and quality.\"\n\nA brief moment of silence had hung over them before Winston mentioned Rose. Instantly, the twitch in Dexter's smile was noticeable as he forced a chuckle, \"She got a good deal on this one. I even had a ride in it with her, that's what earned her trust.\"\n\nAs a detective, one didn't always have the luxury of trusting words at face value. Dexter seemed too polished - too adept at projecting an image. Most importantly, Winston had known about his run for the local office. A scandal was not what he needed. Rose had found out about Dexter's false credentials, and threatened him with exposure.\n\nWinston also remembered the demure set of eyes that stared back at him from an old campus photo during a visit to Dexter's home. Dexter had a degree in Chemistry. Neat rows of labeled chemicals stood proudly on a shelf in his private garage. The detective recognized some of them from his own time in the forensics lab. He had seen the vials labeled 'Acid'. Winston had asked Dexter about the key trace elements for his car sales. Dexter had just brushed it off with a laugh, mentioning they were required for cleaning and various other mundane tasks around the sales lot.\n\nBack at his office, the image of the second set of car keys on Dexter's table resurfaced in his mind. Dexter had explained them as a precaution, an insurance if customers ever lost their keys.\n\n\"Coffee?\" Winston's assistant knocked on his office door, pulling him out of his thoughts.\n\n\"No thanks,\" the detective replied, scribbling something down in his notebook before shuffling his case files together. \"I think I need some fresh air.

Daisy affirmed the fact and mentioned having seen Rose's car, acknowledging that she and Rose were the last two people in the vehicle after her show that night.\\n\\nAs part of her performances, Daisy often integrated different kinds of acid into her routines - the same kind, as it turned out, that had been used to murder Rose. A cold chill ran down Winston\\u2019s spine as he mentally cross-checked the evidence list.\\n\\n\\u201cAcid isn\\u2019t a typical instrument for a singer, Daisy...\\\" Winston quizzed, trying to keep the conversation casual. Daisy just shrugged, \\\"Got to create a spectacle, right? Attract an audience?\\u201d\\n\\nDaisy had always been adamant about not attending any family gatherings - a fact that did not change even after Rose\\u2019s death. But she claimed to hold no ill-will towards Rose. As Winston got up from the table to leave, he turned one final time to look at Daisy who was now alone and engrossed in her phone. A suspect or not, one thing was certain, the story was far from over.\\n\\nAs Winston sat in his office, he sifted through the photos of the crime scene. The car where Rose had met her gruesome end was familiar to him - it was the one Dexter had sold her just a few days ago. He recalled the witness statement he had received, stating that Dexter and Rose were seen driving off in the new car together on the day of the sale.\\n\\nA few days prior, he had stopped by the car dealership for a chat with Dexter. The man was always excitable, energetic - the sort of person you'd expect to be selling cars. But beneath that facade, Winston had glimpsed an undertone of tension. A hint of worry, perhaps? He remembered too the bold campaign posters dotting the walls of the showroom - 'Dexter for Office' they proclaimed, his smiling face lit up by the flash of a professional camera. Maintaining a decent public image was crucial for his campaign.\\n\\n\\\"Beautiful machine, ain't she?\\\" Dexter had commented, patting the bonnet of the vehicle with an almost reverential air. His eyes had been bright as he spoke, \\\"Takes skill to appreciate such precision and quality.\\\"\\n\\nA brief moment of silence had hung over them before Winston mentioned Rose. Instantly, the twitch in Dexter's smile was noticeable as he forced a chuckle, \\\"She got a good deal on this one. I even had a ride in it with her, that's what earned her trust.\\\"\\n\\nAs a detective, one didn't always have the luxury of trusting words at face value. Dexter seemed too polished - too adept at projecting an image. Most importantly, Winston had known about his run for the local office. A scandal was not what he needed. Rose had found out about Dexter's false credentials, and threatened him with exposure.\\n\\nWinston also remembered the demure set of eyes that stared back at him from an old campus photo during a visit to Dexter's home. Dexter had a degree in Chemistry. Neat rows of labeled chemicals stood proudly on a shelf in his private garage. The detective recognized some of them from his own time in the forensics lab. He had seen the vials labeled 'Acid'. Winston had asked Dexter about the key trace elements for his car sales. Dexter had just brushed it off with a laugh, mentioning they were required for cleaning and various other mundane tasks around the sales lot.\\n\\nBack at his office, the image of the second set of car keys on Dexter's table resurfaced in his mind. Dexter had explained them as a precaution, an insurance if customers ever lost their keys.\\n\\n\\\"Coffee?\\\" Winston's assistant knocked on his office door, pulling him out of his thoughts.\\n\\n\\\"No thanks,\\\" the detective replied, scribbling something down in his notebook before shuffling his case files together. \\\"I think I need some fresh air. Let's do a round at the car dealership.\\\"\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Dexter\\n(b) - Daisy\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(a) - Dexter"]], "filtered_resps": ["(a)"], "doc_hash": "e51c5d2a950b126751a6d869394249120c680a23c72e981987d155e9fd2f4438", "prompt_hash": "1b1e8ac8675914c2a6641a86a3beb41de3fbe1da874025f0b5cc1e0d1c91ab74", "target_hash": "e300f251dc09073a9781733cd99758d04a98290157b77fb5c4a986b123900fc6", "exact_match": 0.0}

This was Van, Xenia's accountant, the man whose name is repeated within the pages of her recent will and life insurance policy changes, as sole beneficiary. \n\nVan possessed an imposing frame, earned through countless hours in the gym, evidenced not only by his physique, but by the common knowledge that when not immersed in numerical acrobatics for his clients, Van was often pumping iron. His impressive devotion to physical fitness was a topic of conversation in many social circles, where he was frequently invited but always declined the invitations. Those who knew him joked about how he replaces the traditional 'work hard, play hard' with 'work hard, lift harder'.\n\nA fresh stream of tobacco smoke curled lazily from Winston's cigarette, the detective registered Van's behavior, quiet with a touch of aloofness. It piqued Winston's interest when the burly accountant was asked by a mutual acquaintance about his dating life, he deftly switched the topic to his recent smash of weightlifting records.\n\nVan, it seemed, preferred to shy away from social gatherings and personal inquiries, focusing on his private world of numbers and weights. It was quite a departure from his previous interest in furniture crafting where he had even enrolled in the course on construction safety to hone his hands-on skills.\n\nAll these were pieces of a puzzle Winston was trying to solve, yet there were occasional pieces that invariably stood out, like the receipt of a nail gun purchase Winston had found in Van's wallet and then confirmed by mail from the hardware store.\n\nThe same model nail gun, as the one used to end Xenia's life. A curious coincidence. And with Xenia's vast insurance payout at play and Van's trigger-happy finger on her life insurance policy alteration, Winston prodded further into Van's possible involvement. \n\nHe couldn't ignore the specter of Van's towering debts that strayed too close, too often into the spotlight, even this brief encounter.\n\nWinston had come a long way in his career, and he realized he had barely scratched the surface with this accountant.

In fact, she told you directly that she was going to expose your scandal, didn't she?\"\n\nWilfred’s face turned paler, “Well, yes, she did. But--”\n\nWinston grinned, \"Not just trash, Wilfred. She had physical evidence. Documents proving your indiscretion.\"\n\nWilfred gulped. Winston continued, “Her murder coincidentally took place during your unaccounted for period.”\n\nDespite the clear unease on his face, Wilfred sputtered, “I… I… That's impossible.

It was quite a departure from his previous interest in furniture crafting where he had even enrolled in the course on construction safety to hone his hands-on skills.\\n\\nAll these were pieces of a puzzle Winston was trying to solve, yet there were occasional pieces that invariably stood out, like the receipt of a nail gun purchase Winston had found in Van's wallet and then confirmed by mail from the hardware store.\\n\\nThe same model nail gun, as the one used to end Xenia's life.

The room smelled of cleaners, a scent that clashed with the stark reality of its circumstances - a tragic and untimely death. A photograph on the fridge captured his attention - an image of Tessa, alongside a tall, dark-haired woman who he recognized as Penelope, a local tarot reader.\n\nLater on, his investigations led him to the drains where he suspected Penelope's large chemical purchase from the day before had been dumped. The local authorities confirmed it. The incident was also marked by Penelope's unanticipated visit to Tessa's place during which no witness was there to mark her departure. Despite this, a CT-TV camera at the end of Tessa's street had picked up Penelope leaving just before the estimated time of Tessa's death, something that felt unusual given Tessa's friendly, social neighborhood ethos.\n\nPenelope's home struck him as a stark counterpoint to Tessa's clean, modern aesthetic. Her decor smacked of a dark gothic undertone, featuring cherubs and pentagrams.

A bowling alley, deserted, save for a solitary figure slumped over in the congealing slick of his own blood – the scene drenched in a chilling morbidity. \n\nHis suspect was Mia, a waitress at the bowling alley. The late shift was her domain; her eyes, always heavy-lidded with fatigue, had fallen on a familiar figure, Joel, numbingly often. The man had his peculiar habits, including late-night bowling. Mia had a keen knowledge of that; it wasn’t easy to overlook when they regularly crossed paths during her shifts, Joel’s ball thundering and skidding down the shiny lanes.\n\nFiddling with a small, old key on his desk, Winston’s thought went back to his first meeting with Mia. He had found the key while cleaning her table after an interview and asked her about it. Almost flippantly, she mentioned it was for a private mausoleum in the nearby cemetery. The location was within walking distance from her workplace, an old cemetery cloaked in a gloom that seemed centuries old. The eerie part was her odd ritual; post her shift, her coworkers attested to seeing her trudge towards the graveyard regularly, a private pilgrimage in the dead of night.\n\nWinston vividly remembered his surprise when he had found nunchaku, a pair of them, while searching Mia's home. The night visits to the cemetery coupled with the ominous presence of the martial arts weapon was undoubtedly unsettling. Unraveling further, he found out Mia had been practicing and honing her skills with the nunchaku at home, late into the night. For years, she had been devoted to martial arts, with a particular emphasis on the nunchaku, the significance of which crept up on him like a poisonous vine. Her gym was known for teaching the use of this weapon.\n\n\"I suspect you're quite adept at swinging these,\" Winston had said to Mia, gesturing towards the nunchaku that lay on the table between them when he'd confronted her about it later. \n\nMia had smiled enigmatically, her eyes twinkling with the lethality of secrets untold. \"Keep your eyes open, detective,\" she had replied, her voice a chilling sotto voce lingering between them, hang enough in the suffocating silence.\n\nHis thoughts whirling, Winston stubbed out the last of his cigarette. The available evidence was yet to form a coherent story, but Mia was conspicuous. He had ventured into labyrinthian investigations before, but the mystery of Joel's murder felt like uncharted territory. Winston felt a shiver creep into his spine as he got ready for round two with Mia.\n\nWinston stepped into the dimly lit bowling alley, prowling between lanes like a panther on the hunt. An unusual place to be hammered to death, he thought, especially during the graveyard shift, but a good detective never questioned the chosen venues or the hour of the city's grim reaper. Winston surveyed the empty building, the only sound being that of his own boots echoing off the polished hardwood.\n\nThe bartender, one Rosemary – if her nameplate could be trusted – was scrubbing down a countertop at the far corner of the bar. Winston walked over, took a seat on one of the bar stools and introduced himself. \n\n\"I hear you were working here the night Joel was killed,\" he mentioned, as he watched her movements. \n\nRosemary looked up, her face impassive, \"Yes, that's true. It was my usual midnight shift, and Joel got murdered after we had closed down for the night. Wasn't much else to do.\"\n\n\"You seem to have keys to this place,\" Winston noticed, spotting a set of keys on the counter. \n\n\"Yes, I do, for closing hours,\" she replied, sliding the keys back into her jeans pocket.\n\nHe continued his questions, \"I understand you practice martial arts, Rosemary?\"\n\nFor the first time, Rosemary stopped her cleaning and smiled, \"Yes, that's right. In fact, I work out regularly at a martial arts gym. Nunchaku workshops are my favorite,\" she added, her eyes twinkling with something akin to pride.\n\nWinston nodded, imparting no judgement on her preferred pastime. \n\nSuddenly, a glint at the corner of the room caught his attention. A collection of weaponry displayed on a wall. Upon closer look, he recognized various martial arts weapons, including a pair of nunchaku.\n\n“My father was a big fan of martial arts. He left me his collection,\" explained Rosemary, noticing his interest. \"In fact, the nunchaku you see hanging on the wall is part of my personal collection.\"\n\nAs Winston stood up to leave, he turned to Rosemary, \"Did you know Joel well?\"\n\nShe hesitated for a moment, her eyes downcast, \"Joel... he was a good friend. He always wanted to help. And he was the one person who could save me from this terrible debt I'm wrestling with. But to my despair, he... he said no when I asked him for a loan.\"\n\nAs Winston exited the empty bowling alley, he couldn't help but mull over Rosemary's last words.

The night visits to the cemetery coupled with the ominous presence of the martial arts weapon was undoubtedly unsettling. Unraveling further, he found out Mia had been practicing and honing her skills with the nunchaku at home, late into the night. For years, she had been devoted to martial arts, with a particular emphasis on the nunchaku, the significance of which crept up on him like a poisonous vine. Her gym was known for teaching the use of this weapon.\\n\\n\\\"I suspect you're quite adept at swinging these,\\\" Winston had said to Mia, gesturing towards the nunchaku that lay on the table between them when he'd confronted her about it later. \\n\\nMia had smiled enigmatically, her eyes twinkling with the lethality of secrets untold. \\\"Keep your eyes open, detective,\\\" she had replied, her voice a chilling sotto voce lingering between them, hang enough in the suffocating silence.\\n\\nHis thoughts whirling, Winston stubbed out the last of his cigarette. The available evidence was yet to form a coherent story, but Mia was conspicuous. He had ventured into labyrinthian investigations before, but the mystery of Joel's murder felt like uncharted territory. Winston felt a shiver creep into his spine as he got ready for round two with Mia.\\n\\nWinston stepped into the dimly lit bowling alley, prowling between lanes like a panther on the hunt. An unusual place to be hammered to death, he thought, especially during the graveyard shift, but a good detective never questioned the chosen venues or the hour of the city's grim reaper. Winston surveyed the empty building, the only sound being that of his own boots echoing off the polished hardwood.\\n\\nThe bartender, one Rosemary \\u2013 if her nameplate could be trusted \\u2013 was scrubbing down a countertop at the far corner of the bar. Winston walked over, took a seat on one of the bar stools and introduced himself. \\n\\n\\\"I hear you were working here the night Joel was killed,\\\" he mentioned, as he watched her movements. \\n\\nRosemary looked up, her face impassive, \\\"Yes, that's true. It was my usual midnight shift, and Joel got murdered after we had closed down for the night. Wasn't much else to do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You seem to have keys to this place,\\\" Winston noticed, spotting a set of keys on the counter. \\n\\n\\\"Yes, I do, for closing hours,\\\" she replied, sliding the keys back into her jeans pocket.\\n\\nHe continued his questions, \\\"I understand you practice martial arts, Rosemary?\\\"\\n\\nFor the first time, Rosemary stopped her cleaning and smiled, \\\"Yes, that's right. In fact, I work out regularly at a martial arts gym. Nunchaku workshops are my favorite,\\\" she added, her eyes twinkling with something akin to pride.\\n\\nWinston nodded, imparting no judgement on her preferred pastime. \\n\\nSuddenly, a glint at the corner of the room caught his attention. A collection of weaponry displayed on a wall. Upon closer look, he recognized various martial arts weapons, including a pair of nunchaku.\\n\\n\\u201cMy father was a big fan of martial arts. He left me his collection,\\\" explained Rosemary, noticing his interest. \\\"In fact, the nunchaku you see hanging on the wall is part of my personal collection.\\\"\\n\\nAs Winston stood up to leave, he turned to Rosemary, \\\"Did you know Joel well?\\\"\\n\\nShe hesitated for a moment, her eyes downcast, \\\"Joel... he was a good friend. He always wanted to help. And he was the one person who could save me from this terrible debt I'm wrestling with. But to my despair, he... he said no when I asked him for a loan.\\\"\\n\\nAs Winston exited the empty bowling alley, he couldn't help but mull over Rosemary's last words. This was shaping up to be a long investigation, a fact he was all too aware of as he walked into the piercing chill of the night cityscape.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Rosemary\\n(b) - Mia\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(b) - Mia"]], "filtered_resps": ["(b)"], "doc_hash": "330fe635ac193890791e541a29456b8e2ad817250bc4a663cb423969d6325d5d", "prompt_hash": "de962b77dccd4982a1f7737cf128f5924b976ec351e3ff8e3340e8a7a5af9294", "target_hash": "e300f251dc09073a9781733cd99758d04a98290157b77fb5c4a986b123900fc6", "exact_match": 0.0}

{"doc_id": 67, "doc": {"narrative": "In the mystifying quiet of a mosque, Isabella was found lifeless, a nunchaku the lone cause, casting Detective Winston into a whirlwind investigation with suspects Malaysia and Richard at the heart of the mystery.\n\nDetective Winston was in his office, pouring over the facts of the Isabella case. Isabella was a young woman murdered in a mosque with a pair of nunchaku. Her case was sent to him because not only was the method of murder unusual but the strange behavior she'd reported was disconcerting.\n\nIsabella had reported suspicious activity to the authorities, claiming an acquaintance named Malaysia was acting out of sorts. The name Malaysia was ringing alarm bells for Winston. The police had already questioned her regarding a theft, and now, with Isabella's murder, he felt the need to dig deeper.\n\nWinston knocked on the door of Malaysia's small home, case files in hand. She was a hairdresser by trade, known to be a fan of martial arts movies, placing Bruce Lee as her idol, and had a knack for practicing martial arts moves at home. She had purchased nunchaku recently.  \n\nWinston was greeted with a jovial smile when he arrived, and once pleasantries were exchanged, his questions began.\n\n“I noticed a uniform in that bag by your door,” Winston nodded towards the corner of the room. “You do martial arts?”\n\n“Sure do,” she replied cheerfully. “Nothing like a little kick and a punch after a long day, especially after watching a good martial arts movie.”\n\nWinston watched her closely but Malaysia seemed to only speak the truth. “Did you ever take martial arts classes?”\n\nMalaysia chuckled, “Does high school count? I took it for a few years then. I was a Bruce Lee in the making.”\n\nHe took a deep breath and continued, “What about your family, Malaysia?” Winston asked, trying to dig into her background. \n\nMalaysia shrugged. “Well detective, it's as erratic as the weather these days. Speaking of which, I do believe we are in for some rain later today.\"\n\nFeeling slightly exasperated, Winston decided to prod a bit more. \"And your love life, Malaysia?\" he asked. \n\n\"Oh, it's like 'Gone With The Wind',\" she replied, winking at him. \"An epic which suddenly disappears. Like any good movie, wouldn't you agree, Winston?\"\n\nHe decided to tread lightly. “You ever practice with nunchaku?”\n\nMalaysia’s gaze never wavered, “Oh, sure. Bought a pair recently. They came in handy when Isabella tried taking my TV. Those are some nice detective notes you've got there around a theft, happened a few days ago, isn't it? The police already asked me about those.\"\n\nAs Winston left Malaysia's home, he was left with a feeling of uncertainty. There was much to unravel about this peculiar woman, and he still couldn’t shake off the uneasy feeling of her jovial exterior that hid a string of suspicious facts. Isabella might have been gone, but Winston was determined to uncover the truth for her sake.\n\nWinston eyed the austere environment of the mosque, draped in silence and shadows. As he looked at this deserted place of worship, he thought of the vibrant Isabella, now lying lifeless.\n\nRemembering his conversations with Isabella's friends, he couldn't help but recall them saying how determined she was to escape Richard for good. Isabella's friends had mentioned her to him - how she told them she intended to finally break free from Richard permanently.\n\nHe decided to talk to Richard, a local waiter who had been working at the mosque during those deserted, deadly hours that took Isabella's life.\n\nRichard stood by the main entryway, enduring the barrage of lights and unfamiliar faces. Winston recognized him from his not-so-distant encounter with the law - a case of domestic violence involving him and Isabella.\n\n\"Evening, Richard,\" Winston started, extending a friendly hand. \"Been working here long?\"\n\n\"Few months, sir,\" Richard replied, his voice steady. \"Only serve the occasional visitor during the day. I was alone yesterday. No one else was here.\"\n\nWinston nodded, making a mental note of Richard's presence at the mosque during the time of Isabella's murder. \"I've seen you before. A martial arts class, wasn't it?\"\n\nRichard's gaze flickered with surprise before he recovered, his professional mask back in place. \"Yes. Same class as Isabella.\"\n\nWinston recalled seeing Richard in that martial arts class, practicing nunchaku - the same weapon that had ended Isabella's life.

She was... planning to leave.\"\n\n\"Leave?\" Winston asked, knowing that Isabella had finally decided to break free from Richard permanently. She had even confided in her friends about her escape plans and purchased a ticket for a one-way trip out of the country.\n\n\"Yes...\" Richard's voice was barely audible. \"Leave me. Leave everything.\"\n\nWith that, Winston thanked Richard and turned to leave, his thoughts spinning around the tragic tale of Isabella, her life brutally ended in this quiet mosque she had formerly sought peace.", "question": "Who is the most likely murderer?", "choices": "['Malaysia', 'Richard']", "answer_index": 1, "answer_choice": "Richard"}, "target": "(a)", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": ["[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please answer the following question with (a), (b), (c), (d) \\n\\nIn the mystifying quiet of a mosque, Isabella was found lifeless, a nunchaku the lone cause, casting Detective Winston into a whirlwind investigation with suspects Malaysia and Richard at the heart of the mystery.\\n\\nDetective Winston was in his office, pouring over the facts of the Isabella case. Isabella was a young woman murdered in a mosque with a pair of nunchaku. Her case was sent to him because not only was the method of murder unusual but the strange behavior she'd reported was disconcerting.\\n\\nIsabella had reported suspicious activity to the authorities, claiming an acquaintance named Malaysia was acting out of sorts. The name Malaysia was ringing alarm bells for Winston. The police had already questioned her regarding a theft, and now, with Isabella's murder, he felt the need to dig deeper.\\n\\nWinston knocked on the door of Malaysia's small home, case files in hand. She was a hairdresser by trade, known to be a fan of martial arts movies, placing Bruce Lee as her idol, and had a knack for practicing martial arts moves at home. She had purchased nunchaku recently.  \\n\\nWinston was greeted with a jovial smile when he arrived, and once pleasantries were exchanged, his questions began.\\n\\n\\u201cI noticed a uniform in that bag by your door,\\u201d Winston nodded towards the corner of the room. \\u201cYou do martial arts?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSure do,\\u201d she replied cheerfully. \\u201cNothing like a little kick and a punch after a long day, especially after watching a good martial arts movie.\\u201d\\n\\nWinston watched her closely but Malaysia seemed to only speak the truth. \\u201cDid you ever take martial arts classes?\\u201d\\n\\nMalaysia chuckled, \\u201cDoes high school count? I took it for a few years then. I was a Bruce Lee in the making.\\u201d\\n\\nHe took a deep breath and continued, \\u201cWhat about your family, Malaysia?\\u201d Winston asked, trying to dig into her background. \\n\\nMalaysia shrugged. \\u201cWell detective, it's as erratic as the weather these days. Speaking of which, I do believe we are in for some rain later today.\\\"\\n\\nFeeling slightly exasperated, Winston decided to prod a bit more. \\\"And your love life, Malaysia?\\\" he asked. \\n\\n\\\"Oh, it's like 'Gone With The Wind',\\\" she replied, winking at him. \\\"An epic which suddenly disappears. Like any good movie, wouldn't you agree, Winston?\\\"\\n\\nHe decided to tread lightly. \\u201cYou ever practice with nunchaku?\\u201d\\n\\nMalaysia\\u2019s gaze never wavered, \\u201cOh, sure. Bought a pair recently. They came in handy when Isabella tried taking my TV. Those are some nice detective notes you've got there around a theft, happened a few days ago, isn't it? The police already asked me about those.\\\"\\n\\nAs Winston left Malaysia's home, he was left with a feeling of uncertainty. There was much to unravel about this peculiar woman, and he still couldn\\u2019t shake off the uneasy feeling of her jovial exterior that hid a string of suspicious facts. Isabella might have been gone, but Winston was determined to uncover the truth for her sake.\\n\\nWinston eyed the austere environment of the mosque, draped in silence and shadows. As he looked at this deserted place of worship, he thought of the vibrant Isabella, now lying lifeless.\\n\\nRemembering his conversations with Isabella's friends, he couldn't help but recall them saying how determined she was to escape Richard for good. Isabella's friends had mentioned her to him - how she told them she intended to finally break free from Richard permanently.\\n\\nHe decided to talk to Richard, a local waiter who had been working at the mosque during those deserted, deadly hours that took Isabella's life.\\n\\nRichard stood by the main entryway, enduring the barrage of lights and unfamiliar faces. Winston recognized him from his not-so-distant encounter with the law - a case of domestic violence involving him and Isabella.\\n\\n\\\"Evening, Richard,\\\" Winston started, extending a friendly hand. \\\"Been working here long?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Few months, sir,\\\" Richard replied, his voice steady. \\\"Only serve the occasional visitor during the day. I was alone yesterday. No one else was here.\\\"\\n\\nWinston nodded, making a mental note of Richard's presence at the mosque during the time of Isabella's murder. \\\"I've seen you before. A martial arts class, wasn't it?\\\"\\n\\nRichard's gaze flickered with surprise before he recovered, his professional mask back in place. \\\"Yes. Same class as Isabella.\\\"\\n\\nWinston recalled seeing Richard in that martial arts class, practicing nunchaku - the same weapon that had ended Isabella's life. And not too long ago, he had seen him at the local sports equipment store, purchasing a set of nunchaku.\\n\\n\\\"Quite a skill you've got there,\\\" Winston continued, keeping his voice casual. \\\"Heard you and Isabella trained together.\\\"\\n\\nRichard sighed, his gaze flicked towards the mosque's silent dome. \\\"Yeah, we both were there.

{"doc_id": 72, "doc": {"narrative": "In the deafening silence of an unexpectedly deserted fitness center, Detective Winston finds himself staring at a chilling scene - Isaac's lifeless body riddled with shotgun pellets, leaving Milton and Alice as his primary suspects.\n\nThe late night rain splattered against the dimly lit street as Winston parked his car outside the bustling fitness center. The old dusty building sat in the middle of downtown, open 24 hours to cater to the city-life fitness enthusiasts. The 24-hour timing of the gym provided Isaac a place to be when he was working late. It also afforded Milton, the alleged tax evader and the building owner, numerous opportunities to encounter Isaac.\n\nFor years Winston had known about the gym, a small struggling space owned and operated by Isaac, an IRS agent turned yoga instructor, who had been found dead there the previous night - shot dead with what appeared to be a shotgun. Isaac, with his whistleblowing nature, had recently acquired extensive evidence on a tax evasion scheme. This scheme was alleged to be run by none other than Milton.\n\nWinston spotted Milton, the robust man in his sixties and owner of the building, emerging from the fitness center. An overcast of suspicion hung over Milton as he owned several other buildings in the area, all implicated in his alleged tax evasion scandal.\n\nRevealing his badge, Winston introduced himself, \"Detective Winston. I'd like to ask a few questions.\" Milton, nonchalant as always, simply answered, \"About Isaac?\"\n\n\"Yeah... You knew him well?\"\n\nMilton adjusted the strap of his shotgun before answering, \"He was a tenant. That's all.\"\n\nWinston furrowed his brows, \"That shotgun - it's legal!\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Milton declared, \"I even passed the required training course. The local authorities granted me a license.\"\n\nWinston's eyes darted to the keys in the man's hand, \"I see you also have keys to the gym.\"\n\n\"It's my property, Detective,\" Milton responded dismissively.\n\nWinston sighed, unfazed by Milton's audacity, \"It's undisputed that the gym is never locked yet Isaac was alone last night. He had potential evidence that could have sent you to prison, Milton.\"\n\n\"So?\" Milton's face revealed no fear and no hint of adversity.\n\nThis reaction gnawed at Winston as he returned to his car. Thoughts of Isaac's murder - the shotgun wound matching the one Milton regularly carried, Milton's unfazed demeanor despite the possible charges, and Milton's evident firearms training - swarmed his mind. As he mulled over these facts, he made a mental note to delve deeper into Isaac's evidence - the potential key to exposing Milton's illicit activities and ensuring justice.\n\nWinston squinted his eyes, scanning the familiar hustle and bustle of the fitness center. The crime scene of Isaac's murder was abnormal, the contrast of violence against the backdrop of health and vitality. \n\nDodging a stray basketball, he made his way to the bench where Alice and Isaac used to workout together regularly. Alice had a spotless record with the fitness center - seemed she had never missed a month of membership dues.\n\nAs he advanced, he remembered a fact shared by Alice's friends. They had alluded to how Alice sneakily mentioned fight club every Tuesday night, a pattern they had quickly noticed.\n\nSpotting the middle-aged woman, he strode toward Alice. Her movements were graceful as she pulled down the levels, her muscles contracting with every repetition. She had been in the military, particularly in a special weapons unit where her training with shotguns had given her an edge. Her fitness regime bore witness to that, and she knew her way around weapons- the shotgun she recently purchased was just a testament to that.\n\n\"Hello Alice,\" he initiated the conversation. He knew patience was key in such delicate interrogations, especially with suspects like Alice.\n\n\"Oh, Winston, what an unexpected surprise!\" Alice's face lit up with genuine surprise, her eyes shifting to the shotgun propped at the corner of the bench, its presence undeniable.\n\nDiscarding any pleasantries, Winston moved to the crux of the matter. \"Isaac trained right here didn’t he, you guys used to train together?\"\n\nAlice gave a small nod, memories flickering in her eyes. Winston observed her, recognizing a trace of melancholy. Alice’s dulcet voice broke the silence. \"Yes...we had a sort of routine together.\"\n\nHe glanced at her bruised knuckles appreciatively, a new patch of purple catching his attention. Her friends had mentioned Alice's weekly fight club rendezvous every Tuesday night. The tough soldier, habituated to the brutality of the fight club, would invariably return home every Wednesday morning nursing fresh battle sores.\n\nAlice was a puzzle piece in a complex jigsaw puzzle. An aunt, a loyal fitness center member, a fighter, and undoubtedly an experienced shotgun user due to her military background. Her every Tuesday night fights stood out starkly against her normal routine. She was a conundrum tightly bound by her routine, fitness center membership, military background, and her recent shotgun purchase.\n\n\"You know Winston...Isaac was the only family I had left,\" Alice mused, her thoughts clearly going down a memory lane, her fingers tracing her recent shotgun casually. The shotgun she had recently purchased was now in her possession. With these words, she abruptly stood up, signaled the trainer for her next routine, leaving Winston to join the dots of the puzzle she represented in this murder mystery.", "question": "Who is the most likely murderer?", "choices": "['Milton', 'Alice']", "answer_index": 0, "answer_choice": "Milton"}, "target": "(`)", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": ["[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please answer the following question with (a), (b), (c), (d) \\n\\nIn the deafening silence of an unexpectedly deserted fitness center, Detective Winston finds himself staring at a chilling scene - Isaac's lifeless body riddled with shotgun pellets, leaving Milton and Alice as his primary suspects.\\n\\nThe late night rain splattered against the dimly lit street as Winston parked his car outside the bustling fitness center.

Her fitness regime bore witness to that, and she knew her way around weapons- the shotgun she recently purchased was just a testament to that.\\n\\n\\\"Hello Alice,\\\" he initiated the conversation. He knew patience was key in such delicate interrogations, especially with suspects like Alice.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Winston, what an unexpected surprise!\\\" Alice's face lit up with genuine surprise, her eyes shifting to the shotgun propped at the corner of the bench, its presence undeniable.\\n\\nDiscarding any pleasantries, Winston moved to the crux of the matter. \\\"Isaac trained right here didn\\u2019t he, you guys used to train together?\\\"\\n\\nAlice gave a small nod, memories flickering in her eyes. Winston observed her, recognizing a trace of melancholy. Alice\\u2019s dulcet voice broke the silence. \\\"Yes...we had a sort of routine together.\\\"\\n\\nHe glanced at her bruised knuckles appreciatively, a new patch of purple catching his attention. Her friends had mentioned Alice's weekly fight club rendezvous every Tuesday night. The tough soldier, habituated to the brutality of the fight club, would invariably return home every Wednesday morning nursing fresh battle sores.\\n\\nAlice was a puzzle piece in a complex jigsaw puzzle. An aunt, a loyal fitness center member, a fighter, and undoubtedly an experienced shotgun user due to her military background. Her every Tuesday night fights stood out starkly against her normal routine. She was a conundrum tightly bound by her routine, fitness center membership, military background, and her recent shotgun purchase.\\n\\n\\\"You know Winston...Isaac was the only family I had left,\\\" Alice mused, her thoughts clearly going down a memory lane, her fingers tracing her recent shotgun casually. The shotgun she had recently purchased was now in her possession. With these words, she abruptly stood up, signaled the trainer for her next routine, leaving Winston to join the dots of the puzzle she represented in this murder mystery.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Milton\\n(b) - Alice\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(b) - Alice"]], "filtered_resps": ["(b)"], "doc_hash": "3c80d10edad1d70786408beea30ec80de203902ab31908d054e4cdd22466340d", "prompt_hash": "467a50e9f7be03410ad55e30889c0f5d4fa30cb5a3034dc0d940e46a279ddd30", "target_hash": "e300f251dc09073a9781733cd99758d04a98290157b77fb5c4a986b123900fc6", "exact_match": 0.0}

Milton's tax evasion scheme, his interest in funeral practices, the shotgun license, the matching murder weapon... it all seemed to connect. He was confident that the tax evasion evidence would be enough to send Milton to jail, but for now, only time would tell. It was just another day on the job for Winston.

We all follow procedures.\"\n\nWinston nodded, making noncommittal noise in agreement. Then, he continued, \"Russell, tell me about that trip... the one you took not long ago.\"\n\n\"Oh, that?\" Russell scratched his head, \"Nothing much to tell, I don't fly often, water is more my domain. But yeah, had to visit family, got a ticket for a coastal ride.\"\n\nWinston leaned forward, observing Russell's expressions. \"By coincidence, Zoe was also on that flight, wasn't she?\" \n\nRussell stiffened slightly and Winston noticed the hint of worry crossing his eyes. \"Yeah, small world, innit? She was there, sat right beside me for the entirety of the trip.\"\n\nInquiring further Winston said, “Did she seem jittery to you, Russell? I Received word that she's been contacting the police for quite some time, reporting offenses she's witnessed.”\n\nRussell responded nervously, \"Yeah, heard something similar...It made me uncomfortable, seeing how she started discussing her crime witnessings and all... Well, she even talked about some smuggler group... and I involuntarily disclosed my involvement in questionable activities.

Yes, she did.\"\n\nAfter leaving Russell, Winston couldn't help but think of Zoe and the courage she had exhibited.

And, I remember a gossip at the airport that you specifically saw to it that your seats were together?\"\n\nAlice nodded, her hands shaking slightly. \"Yes, that's why we bought the tickets together.

Being seated close to my companion helps.\" \n\nWinston took that in, feeling a certain satisfaction at the beads of sweat dotting Alice's forehead. \"And you were helping Zoe adjust with air travel like in your flight attendant days, right?\"\n\n\"No,\" Alice said rapidly, her hands touched her chest, and then flittering over the bottles laying around her. \"I... I just comfort her with my spiritual methods.\"\n\nThe detective's keen eyes took note of the bottles, their familiarity stinging his brain.

{"doc_id": 75, "doc": {"narrative": "In the cramped confines of an airplane mid-flight, Zoe was slain using a simple bottle of bleach, propelling Detective Winston into a sky-high murder mystery involving two main suspects: Russell and Alice.\n\nAs detective Winston stared at the boarded up airplane on the tarmac, his mind churned over the limited evidence he had at his disposal. Zoe, the cheerful flight stewardess was the victim, and he was about to interview one of the contentious suspects - a sailor by trade, a man named Russell. Detective Winston had seen him earlier that day. He was watching from a distance as Russell, with animal carcasses in tow, disappeared into his home. Winston didn't believe he had ever come across a more unique assortment of characters in any of his previous investigations. He sighed and decided it was time to meet with Russell, his main course of inquiry for the day.\n\nMaking his way to the docking area in the early morning light, he spotted a weathered sailor hunching over a bucket filled with cleaning supplies on his trawler. Bleach was prominent among them, a bottle of it sitting half used on the washed deck. As Winston approached, Russell began to explain how he had unintentionally injured himself in the past while cleaning his boat with the very same bleach. Despite the painful memory, it seemed he was determined to keep his ship sparking and sanitary as per his sailor training.\n\nDuring their conversation, Russell mentioned his aesthetics and love for taxidermy, a skill he had picked up during one of his various trips abroad, in particular, a trip to Norway. He explained how he always tried to learn something new from every country he visited, and Norway taught him taxidermy. \"And then there's my taxidermy workshop at home, in the basement,\" Russell revealed, \"...probably filled with dust bunnies now.\" He even told Winston about several animal carcasses he planned to work with later that evening in his basement workshop.\n\nFeeling he had gained his trust, Winston eased into the events which transpired in the airplane, \"You boarded the flight with Zoe, correct?\" Russell nodded, wrinkling his already weather-worn face. He began to retell his version of events. Winston noted that Russell started with how he found himself sitting next to Zoe on the airplane, further deepening their connection. From shared cab glasses to a friendly conversation which culminated in Russell offering Zoe a drink during the flight, the events were building up to an intricate narrative. Winston stored away these significant details which included their seating arrangement on the flight, to review later.\n\nAs the day wore on, Winston decided to wrap up his inquiry. Confirming with Russell his ticket receipt and presence on the same flight with Zoe, he felt he was making progress. An observing officer had provided his statement of seeing Russell board the same plane as Zoe. This was slowly shaping up into a complex murder mystery involving a sailor, bleach, taxidermy, and air travel. Winston ended his day at a local bar, quietly replaying the events of the day, piecing together this unique puzzle to get closer to the truth.\n\nThe piercing glare of Detective Winston enveloped the flamboyant spiritual guru Alice, as she walked towards him under the high terminal ceilings of the airport. Clad in flowing robes with bottles of various shapes and sizes dangling from her belt, she confidently greeted him. \n\n\"Detective Winston, I was expecting you. After all, one doesn't have to be a spiritual guru to know that after what happened, the police would want answers.\"\n\nWinston viewed her flamboyant getup briefly and caught sight of the wide variety of bottles she lugged around. Among them were the weirdly familiar-looking bleach bottles.\n\nAlice's past as a flight attendant was no secret. Through that career, she also formed a close bond with Zoe. They recently boarded a plane together in order to attend a spiritual retreat. Alice had been meticulous in arranging the journey, purchasing tickets specifically for seats next to each other.\n\nSundrenched in conversation, one fact kept flashing in Winston's mind. Zoe had found documents against Alice; a heap of paperwork that cast these spiritual practices in a harsh and fraudulent light. One crucial point Alice admitted to was being present when Zoe discovered these damning papers. \n\nA gentle rustling of papers revealed that Alice had also seen Zoe making copies of these records. In the ambiguous silence, Alice poured herself a drink from one of her many bottles. She couldn't help but mention Zoe's preference for the same beverage that she carried in the same bag where the bleach-like bottles sat nestled.\n\n\"I accidentally sipped bleach once,\" Alice suddenly offered up, piling pressure on the unsaid words looming between them. \"The hospital visit wasn't pleasant.\" \n\nThe detective's eyes shifted from Alice to her hands.

Zoe, the cheerful flight stewardess was the victim, and he was about to interview one of the contentious suspects - a sailor by trade, a man named Russell. Detective Winston had seen him earlier that day. He was watching from a distance as Russell, with animal carcasses in tow, disappeared into his home. Winston didn't believe he had ever come across a more unique assortment of characters in any of his previous investigations. He sighed and decided it was time to meet with Russell, his main course of inquiry for the day.\\n\\nMaking his way to the docking area in the early morning light, he spotted a weathered sailor hunching over a bucket filled with cleaning supplies on his trawler. Bleach was prominent among them, a bottle of it sitting half used on the washed deck. As Winston approached, Russell began to explain how he had unintentionally injured himself in the past while cleaning his boat with the very same bleach. Despite the painful memory, it seemed he was determined to keep his ship sparking and sanitary as per his sailor training.\\n\\nDuring their conversation, Russell mentioned his aesthetics and love for taxidermy, a skill he had picked up during one of his various trips abroad, in particular, a trip to Norway. He explained how he always tried to learn something new from every country he visited, and Norway taught him taxidermy. \\\"And then there's my taxidermy workshop at home, in the basement,\\\" Russell revealed, \\\"...probably filled with dust bunnies now.\\\" He even told Winston about several animal carcasses he planned to work with later that evening in his basement workshop.\\n\\nFeeling he had gained his trust, Winston eased into the events which transpired in the airplane, \\\"You boarded the flight with Zoe, correct?\\\" Russell nodded, wrinkling his already weather-worn face. He began to retell his version of events. Winston noted that Russell started with how he found himself sitting next to Zoe on the airplane, further deepening their connection. From shared cab glasses to a friendly conversation which culminated in Russell offering Zoe a drink during the flight, the events were building up to an intricate narrative. Winston stored away these significant details which included their seating arrangement on the flight, to review later.\\n\\nAs the day wore on, Winston decided to wrap up his inquiry. Confirming with Russell his ticket receipt and presence on the same flight with Zoe, he felt he was making progress. An observing officer had provided his statement of seeing Russell board the same plane as Zoe. This was slowly shaping up into a complex murder mystery involving a sailor, bleach, taxidermy, and air travel. Winston ended his day at a local bar, quietly replaying the events of the day, piecing together this unique puzzle to get closer to the truth.\\n\\nThe piercing glare of Detective Winston enveloped the flamboyant spiritual guru Alice, as she walked towards him under the high terminal ceilings of the airport. Clad in flowing robes with bottles of various shapes and sizes dangling from her belt, she confidently greeted him. \\n\\n\\\"Detective Winston, I was expecting you. After all, one doesn't have to be a spiritual guru to know that after what happened, the police would want answers.\\\"\\n\\nWinston viewed her flamboyant getup briefly and caught sight of the wide variety of bottles she lugged around. Among them were the weirdly familiar-looking bleach bottles.\\n\\nAlice's past as a flight attendant was no secret. Through that career, she also formed a close bond with Zoe. They recently boarded a plane together in order to attend a spiritual retreat. Alice had been meticulous in arranging the journey, purchasing tickets specifically for seats next to each other.\\n\\nSundrenched in conversation, one fact kept flashing in Winston's mind. Zoe had found documents against Alice; a heap of paperwork that cast these spiritual practices in a harsh and fraudulent light. One crucial point Alice admitted to was being present when Zoe discovered these damning papers. \\n\\nA gentle rustling of papers revealed that Alice had also seen Zoe making copies of these records. In the ambiguous silence, Alice poured herself a drink from one of her many bottles. She couldn't help but mention Zoe's preference for the same beverage that she carried in the same bag where the bleach-like bottles sat nestled.\\n\\n\\\"I accidentally sipped bleach once,\\\" Alice suddenly offered up, piling pressure on the unsaid words looming between them. \\\"The hospital visit wasn't pleasant.\\\" \\n\\nThe detective's eyes shifted from Alice to her hands. The bottles she was carrying flaunts similar size and shape to that of a bleach bottle. \\n\\n\\\"There is this spiritual cleansing practice,\\\" Alice continued, \\\"It involves the ingestion of bleach. Out of curiosity, I researched its effects.

The victim, Floyd, lay lifeless on the floor, an unlikely end to his ruthless pursuit of money. Floyd had refused to give up on collecting from Catherine, an airline pilot who had fallen on some hard times with missed mortgage payment after missed mortgage payment.\n\nStepping away from the crime scene, Winston called in a visit to Catherine. Her house felt quiet, almost sparse, a faint memory of better times perhaps reflected in something he noticed frequently in the past few weeks - her obsessively reading through her scrapbook, scanning, examining, dwelling in her past. It was hard to imagine a woman like Catherine having to sell her own plane, but interestingly enough, substantial debt and strain could cause people to do things they wouldn't ordinarily consider.\n\nAs Winston noticed Catherine walking up to the front door, an odd sight caught his eye. Catherine was holding her well-thumbed scrapbook in one hand, and newspaper clippings and obituaries littered the ground around her. A more careful look revealed an extensive collection of obituaries forming a large part of her scrapbook. The other hand held a familiar object – a pair of scissors – as she cut out pieces of articles to add to her collection. And discarded scrap clippings ferried by the breeze were scattered about. It was clear that the scrapbook activity was a frequent one. Task completed, she then tucked the scissors back into a bag that also concealed a shiv. Catherine felt a certain sense of comfort and preparedness when she had her shiv at hand. Her military background had made her adept at it, and she had never stopped carrying one, even after leaving the service.\n\n\"Catherine?\" Winston asked, subtly studying her.\n\n\"Yes, that's me,\" Catherine responded without trying to read into his intent.\n\n\"You were in the military, right?\"\n\n\"Correct. Piloting planes wasn't my start.\" She retorted, the scars of battles both physical and mental marked meditatively on her persona. Indeed, she was an unlikely debtor, having once been highly trained personnel in military combat – the shiv was her preferred weapon, which she'd practiced with consistently after her service days.\n\nWinston noticed the agitation in her eyes as they turned to the topic of Floyd. It was evident Floyd's continuous demand for money had stirred up enough frustration and desperation within Catherine, and the fact that he was planning to take legal action against her only added fuel to the fire.\n\n\"Well, Catherine. Nice talking to you,\" Winston said, standing up from the porch steps. \"This is routine, we're talking to everyone Floyd knew.\"\n\n\"Of course, detective. I understand,\" Catherine said, her rigid military bearing showing through.\n\nAs Winston drove away, he couldn't help but replay the entire conversation in his head. Flight or fight. In Catherine’s case, she was always prepared to do either, hence the shiv in her bag. With her financial situation forcing her into a corner, it seemed like fight was becoming her only option.\n\nWinston browsed through the case file while sipping his freshly brewed coffee. The victim, Floyd, was found dead in the library, dead from puncture and cut wounds, potentially from a shiv- an easy enough weapon to make or find.\n\nHe sat back in his chair, looking over the CCTV footage from the library. The video stream showed Zara, a local fashion designer known for her extravagant style and equally extravagant temper, walking in and out of the library on the day of the crime. That wouldn't normally place her as a suspect... if it hadn't been for the fact that Floyd and Zara didn't exactly get along.\n\nFloyd had told friends on numerous occasions how Zara had asked him for money, a request he'd always refused.

He looked again at the CCTV recording of Zara. She seemed on edge, showing the typical nervous energy of someone under the influence of drugs.

His next interview would be with Samuel, the paramedic who had attended to their deceased and who was, unfortunately, on duty that day of the murder.\n\nWinston drove to the medical supply store, where his potential suspect was apparently employed. He found Samuel scrubbing down the glass doors of the facility, glimpsing the red-cross logo stitched on his uniform shoulder.\n\n\"Samuel?\" Winston queried, getting out of his car. \n\n“Yeah, that’s me,\" came the tired response. Samuel looked up from his task, tossing a quick glance at the detective’s badge.\n\n“My name’s Detective Winston. I need to speak with you about a few things. Mind if we step inside?” \n\n“Sure, detective,” Samuel gestured toward the main entrance and Winston followed. \n\nOnce inside, Samuel's persona changed. Winston noticed the way he moved around the shelves, the confidence in his steps. The paramedic knew his way around medical supplies. His extensive training had equipped him with the knowledge to deal with a variety of emergency situations, including trauma inflicted by barbed wire.\n\nA jangling of keys pulled Winston's attention back to Samuel. He was unlocking a storage unit near the far end of the store, revealing shelves lined with a variety of products, including a roll of barbed wire. \n\n\"Just restocking,\" Samuel explained, but Detective Winston made no response - it wasn't his place to draw conclusions. He pulled out his small notebook from his back pocket, jotting down a few insignificant details before closing it again.\n\nLater that day, Winston visited Isolde’s workspace, noting the appointment book left open on her desk. It showed a visit from Samuel penciled in at a noontime slot, the same day Isolde was murdered. \n\nBuried under the papers on Isolde's desk, the detective found a DVD labeled \"Surgical Errors,\" - the video evidence of Samuel's medical malpractice. It was clear Isolde had been collecting her evidence against Samuel.\n\nHe next met with Isolde’s secretary, who was visibly shaken. \"Yes, Detective. I remember confirming Samuel’s appointment.\" she mentioned, “I believe it was his medical review?\"\n\nWinston nodded, making no comment. He reflected upon the video evidence he had found at Isolde’s office. The recording that allegedly held evidence of Samuel's botched surgery had now become more significant.\n\nHe returned back to his car, pondering over the details of Samuel's superior who had warned him about the potential job loss and jail time, given his recent errors. \n\nHis last snippet of information had come from a security guard at Isolde's building who had seen Samuel entering her office on the day of the murder.\n\nWinston felt the familiar burn of an overworked mind. But he kept his thoughts at bay as he rounded out his day. The puzzle pieces were often murky, and their connections circumstantial. His job was to find them, and affix them one by one until the whole image revealed itself.\n\nWinston was staring at his murky reflection in the last few drops of coffee. Isolde was dead, strangled in her home office, possibly by her roommate and partner in crime, Bernard. Together, Bernard and Isolde were involved in some mystifying activities, being partners in their dubious affairs while sharing the same living space. \n\nWinston sighed and thought to his next interview, Bernard. He was next on Winston's list. Known as a cattle rancher in town, Bernard made his living through the ranching business. He was also known for his suspiciously close relationship with Isolde, as they not only shared a living area but were partners in crime.\n\nUpon entering the ranch, Winston noticed Bernard wearing a rugged cowboy hat and a pair of gloves, trying to fix a broken fence. Intriguingly, there was no barbed wire in sight, an important element for a ranch fence. Winston had received a report about missing barbed wire from this very ranch, and here, he was staring at an opened box that should have contained barbed wires for the fence. \n\nOver a bitter cup of coffee, Winston began his inquiries. \"Heard about your Halloween contest victory, Bernard. Hannibal Lecter impersonation, was it?\" \n\nBernard smiled, his eyes glinting, \"Oh yeah, good times. Did an Anthony Perkins one at the last party too, from Psycho.\" Many at the party overheard Bernard reciting Anthony Perkins' lines with unnerving accuracy.\n\nWinston thought about the strangeness of the situation, a man so obsessed with horror and thrillers, impersonating characters from such genre. Bernard might have been telling the truth, but it was part of Winston's job to consider all possibilities.\n\nBernard happily divulged how he frequently visits speciality stores to buy all kinds of horror and thriller movies. His eyes lit up with excitement as he spoke about his dedicated room for his extensive movie collection, featuring an array of thrillers with Anthony Perkins' Psycho as the crown jewel.\n\nWhen Winston asked Bernard for an alibi on the night of Isolde's murder, Bernard reaffirmed he didn't invite anyone else and that he was home alone that night. No neighbors reported any visitors to his residence during the time of the crime. Winston asked Bernard if he noticed anything out of the ordinary during that time, to which Bernard looked puzzled and shook his head.\n\nWinston finished his coffee and made his way towards the door. As he left Bernard's ranch, he noted the puzzling absence of the barbed wire from the fences, Bernard's conspicuous enthusiasm for horror characters, and the deafening silence from the neighbors about any missing barbed wire. The picture was becoming clearer. What conclusions these facts would lead to, that was for a later time.

It showed a visit from Samuel penciled in at a noontime slot, the same day Isolde was murdered. \\n\\nBuried under the papers on Isolde's desk, the detective found a DVD labeled \\\"Surgical Errors,\\\" - the video evidence of Samuel's medical malpractice. It was clear Isolde had been collecting her evidence against Samuel.\\n\\nHe next met with Isolde\\u2019s secretary, who was visibly shaken. \\\"Yes, Detective. I remember confirming Samuel\\u2019s appointment.\\\" she mentioned, \\u201cI believe it was his medical review?\\\"\\n\\nWinston nodded, making no comment. He reflected upon the video evidence he had found at Isolde\\u2019s office. The recording that allegedly held evidence of Samuel's botched surgery had now become more significant.\\n\\nHe returned back to his car, pondering over the details of Samuel's superior who had warned him about the potential job loss and jail time, given his recent errors. \\n\\nHis last snippet of information had come from a security guard at Isolde's building who had seen Samuel entering her office on the day of the murder.\\n\\nWinston felt the familiar burn of an overworked mind. But he kept his thoughts at bay as he rounded out his day. The puzzle pieces were often murky, and their connections circumstantial. His job was to find them, and affix them one by one until the whole image revealed itself.\\n\\nWinston was staring at his murky reflection in the last few drops of coffee. Isolde was dead, strangled in her home office, possibly by her roommate and partner in crime, Bernard. Together, Bernard and Isolde were involved in some mystifying activities, being partners in their dubious affairs while sharing the same living space. \\n\\nWinston sighed and thought to his next interview, Bernard. He was next on Winston's list. Known as a cattle rancher in town, Bernard made his living through the ranching business. He was also known for his suspiciously close relationship with Isolde, as they not only shared a living area but were partners in crime.\\n\\nUpon entering the ranch, Winston noticed Bernard wearing a rugged cowboy hat and a pair of gloves, trying to fix a broken fence. Intriguingly, there was no barbed wire in sight, an important element for a ranch fence. Winston had received a report about missing barbed wire from this very ranch, and here, he was staring at an opened box that should have contained barbed wires for the fence. \\n\\nOver a bitter cup of coffee, Winston began his inquiries. \\\"Heard about your Halloween contest victory, Bernard. Hannibal Lecter impersonation, was it?\\\" \\n\\nBernard smiled, his eyes glinting, \\\"Oh yeah, good times. Did an Anthony Perkins one at the last party too, from Psycho.\\\" Many at the party overheard Bernard reciting Anthony Perkins' lines with unnerving accuracy.\\n\\nWinston thought about the strangeness of the situation, a man so obsessed with horror and thrillers, impersonating characters from such genre. Bernard might have been telling the truth, but it was part of Winston's job to consider all possibilities.\\n\\nBernard happily divulged how he frequently visits speciality stores to buy all kinds of horror and thriller movies. His eyes lit up with excitement as he spoke about his dedicated room for his extensive movie collection, featuring an array of thrillers with Anthony Perkins' Psycho as the crown jewel.\\n\\nWhen Winston asked Bernard for an alibi on the night of Isolde's murder, Bernard reaffirmed he didn't invite anyone else and that he was home alone that night. No neighbors reported any visitors to his residence during the time of the crime. Winston asked Bernard if he noticed anything out of the ordinary during that time, to which Bernard looked puzzled and shook his head.\\n\\nWinston finished his coffee and made his way towards the door. As he left Bernard's ranch, he noted the puzzling absence of the barbed wire from the fences, Bernard's conspicuous enthusiasm for horror characters, and the deafening silence from the neighbors about any missing barbed wire. The picture was becoming clearer. What conclusions these facts would lead to, that was for a later time. For now, he had to focus on gathering more crucial facts and information about the suspicious circumstances surrounding Isolde's death.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Samuel\\n(b) - Bernard\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(a) - Samuel"]], "filtered_resps": ["(a)"], "doc_hash": "7e8d1104b78ca0f97d2c6e15ee40d7bad1ce3b2871372e14d9049a75bcacbf6c", "prompt_hash": "22be020f24dadaa19c4609fca05e505af4db045a4a444736904f45248653a2cf", "target_hash": "e300f251dc09073a9781733cd99758d04a98290157b77fb5c4a986b123900fc6", "exact_match": 0.0}

{"doc_id": 83, "doc": {"narrative": "When Roxanne drops dead at the local skate park, the unlikely cause of death being poison from a rare frog, Detective Winston finds himself mired in questioning two intriguing suspects, Stacey and Hector.\n\nWinston sat in his well-worn desk chair, the room lit by the soft yellow hue of the lamp light. He leaned back, studying the sheet of information about Stacey, a known hiker, who had a unique interest in poison dart frogs. \n\nGlancing at Stacey's social media profile, he noticed posts about her numerous trips to the forests populated with these amphibians. Winston found himself flicking through various posts: an essay on the diet of poison dart frogs, vacation videos of her trips, and pictures of her hiking in the rainforest. \n\nDuring his investigation, he discovered that Stacey owned a collection of true crime documentaries. She spent much of her free time watching these documentaries, studying each event meticulously. Winston found it interesting to note that she discussed particular details from her notes with her friends during their local meetings. \n\nNext, he found a pet store receipt. A local pet store clerk had confirmed that Stacey had recently bought an unusual pet: a poison dart frog, one of the most venomous amphibians in the world.\n\nShe was also a former skater, well-known for her unique skating design which she seemed to have stopped after a certain point. He found some pictures of her in mid-flight, her moves elegant and effortless. \n\nConversations had been had about a particular incident involving Roxanne, the victim. It seemed Roxanne’s rise to fame came shortly after Stacey stopped skating. It was public knowledge that Roxanne's sensational success was off the back of what appeared to be Stacey’s unique style. \n\nThere was also talk about how Stacey faced ridicule from friends and acquaintances who used to adore her designs. Roxanne had managed to outshine her, using Stacey’s ideas for personal gain for which she took all the credit.\n\nWinston closed his notebook, sighing deeply, and flicked off the lamp light. The pieces of the puzzle began to form a picture, but for now, the detective had to report back to headquarters, leaving the specimen under a magnifying glass, awaiting further analysis.\n\nSquinting against the harsh sunlight, Detective Winston strolled through the bustling skate park frequently visited by both Hector and his victim, Roxanne. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a casually dressed man sitting on a wooden ramp, Hector.\n\nHector was a flight attendant, an occupation that requires frequent travel. Lately, his route was often to South America, a realm teeming with a wide range of amphibian species, including a certain frog species that produces lethal poison. Winston discovered this after studying his flight records which showed multiple trips to countries renowned for their amphibian diversity. He had no accountable alibi during the time of the murder. Despite the demanding schedule, he maintained a remarkable career in the industry.\n\n\"Hello, Hector,\" Winston greeted, careful not to reveal an ounce of suspicion.\n\n\"Oh! Detective Winston,\" Hector replied, appearing taken aback. \"What brings you here?\"\n\n\"Just passing through,\" Winston shrugged, casually observing the adrenaline-fueled stunts coming to life around them.\n\n\" I see,\" Hector's eyes followed Winston's gaze. \"I often come here, it's a good distraction,\" he added, something approaching regret marring his features. Hector then mentioned his usual habit, \"Whenever I come here, I always sign-in at the reception. Did the same on the day of the murder and thereafter stayed around the vicinity of the crime scene.\"\n\n\"I heard,\" Winston nodded, gliding his fingers over the smooth, worn-out surface of the ramp.\n\nA peculiar thing about Hector was his educational background. He wasn't initially an aviation enthusiast; rather, he had a degree in biology, specifically amphibians.\n\n\"You studied frogs in school, didn't you?\" Winston casually dropped the question, forcing himself not to observe Hector closely.\n\n\"Yes, that's right. Interesting creatures, they are. Lots of them in South America too,\" Hector affirmed with an enthusiastic nod. Winston noticed how he specifically mentioned the frogs, especially those indigenous to South America.\n\nThe chill of the evening began to set in, just as their presence near the crime scene did. This park was just a stone's throw away from where Roxanne, a promising young soul, met her untimely end due to a peculiar poison – derived from a specific frog, found solely in South America.\n\nWith this in the back of his mind, Winston focused back on Hector. He and Roxanne had history. A romantic history, to be precise. However, their affair was on the verge of exposure —Roxanne had threatened to tell Hector's wife about their infidelity. On the day Roxanne died, Hector, having no accountable alibi, had signed in at this very skate park.\n\n\"Well, Hector, it got colder.

He leaned back, studying the sheet of information about Stacey, a known hiker, who had a unique interest in poison dart frogs. \\n\\nGlancing at Stacey's social media profile, he noticed posts about her numerous trips to the forests populated with these amphibians. Winston found himself flicking through various posts: an essay on the diet of poison dart frogs, vacation videos of her trips, and pictures of her hiking in the rainforest. \\n\\nDuring his investigation, he discovered that Stacey owned a collection of true crime documentaries. She spent much of her free time watching these documentaries, studying each event meticulously. Winston found it interesting to note that she discussed particular details from her notes with her friends during their local meetings. \\n\\nNext, he found a pet store receipt. A local pet store clerk had confirmed that Stacey had recently bought an unusual pet: a poison dart frog, one of the most venomous amphibians in the world.\\n\\nShe was also a former skater, well-known for her unique skating design which she seemed to have stopped after a certain point. He found some pictures of her in mid-flight, her moves elegant and effortless. \\n\\nConversations had been had about a particular incident involving Roxanne, the victim. It seemed Roxanne\\u2019s rise to fame came shortly after Stacey stopped skating. It was public knowledge that Roxanne's sensational success was off the back of what appeared to be Stacey\\u2019s unique style. \\n\\nThere was also talk about how Stacey faced ridicule from friends and acquaintances who used to adore her designs. Roxanne had managed to outshine her, using Stacey\\u2019s ideas for personal gain for which she took all the credit.\\n\\nWinston closed his notebook, sighing deeply, and flicked off the lamp light. The pieces of the puzzle began to form a picture, but for now, the detective had to report back to headquarters, leaving the specimen under a magnifying glass, awaiting further analysis.\\n\\nSquinting against the harsh sunlight, Detective Winston strolled through the bustling skate park frequently visited by both Hector and his victim, Roxanne. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a casually dressed man sitting on a wooden ramp, Hector.\\n\\nHector was a flight attendant, an occupation that requires frequent travel. Lately, his route was often to South America, a realm teeming with a wide range of amphibian species, including a certain frog species that produces lethal poison. Winston discovered this after studying his flight records which showed multiple trips to countries renowned for their amphibian diversity. He had no accountable alibi during the time of the murder. Despite the demanding schedule, he maintained a remarkable career in the industry.\\n\\n\\\"Hello, Hector,\\\" Winston greeted, careful not to reveal an ounce of suspicion.\\n\\n\\\"Oh! Detective Winston,\\\" Hector replied, appearing taken aback. \\\"What brings you here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just passing through,\\\" Winston shrugged, casually observing the adrenaline-fueled stunts coming to life around them.\\n\\n\\\" I see,\\\" Hector's eyes followed Winston's gaze. \\\"I often come here, it's a good distraction,\\\" he added, something approaching regret marring his features. Hector then mentioned his usual habit, \\\"Whenever I come here, I always sign-in at the reception. Did the same on the day of the murder and thereafter stayed around the vicinity of the crime scene.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I heard,\\\" Winston nodded, gliding his fingers over the smooth, worn-out surface of the ramp.\\n\\nA peculiar thing about Hector was his educational background. He wasn't initially an aviation enthusiast; rather, he had a degree in biology, specifically amphibians.\\n\\n\\\"You studied frogs in school, didn't you?\\\" Winston casually dropped the question, forcing himself not to observe Hector closely.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, that's right. Interesting creatures, they are. Lots of them in South America too,\\\" Hector affirmed with an enthusiastic nod. Winston noticed how he specifically mentioned the frogs, especially those indigenous to South America.\\n\\nThe chill of the evening began to set in, just as their presence near the crime scene did. This park was just a stone's throw away from where Roxanne, a promising young soul, met her untimely end due to a peculiar poison \\u2013 derived from a specific frog, found solely in South America.\\n\\nWith this in the back of his mind, Winston focused back on Hector. He and Roxanne had history. A romantic history, to be precise. However, their affair was on the verge of exposure \\u2014Roxanne had threatened to tell Hector's wife about their infidelity. On the day Roxanne died, Hector, having no accountable alibi, had signed in at this very skate park.\\n\\n\\\"Well, Hector, it got colder. Time I get back home,\\\" Winston said, pushing away from the ramp.

He watched as Gregory, the auctioneer, went about his usual business. This case didn't seem too out of the ordinary at first, another murder with plenty of unanswered questions. But Gregory was in the sights.\n\nHe had been observing Gregory for some time now and knew that he frequented the local jazz club just down the street after auction nights. In fact, on the night of the murder, Gregory had been seen leaving the auction and going straight to the club. Winston glanced down the street at the club's flickering neon sign which was a painful reminder of where Abigail had taken her last breath.\n\nHe stepped out of the car, barely pausing to trace the path Gregory would have walked that night, before entering the auction house. Throughout their conversation, Gregory seemed more pressured than typical auctioneers. Winston got the impression that Gregory was worried about something… He had learned through his observations that Gregory often stayed behind after auctions to go over the inventory. As the lead auctioneer, he had unrestricted access to the dagger collection, even after hours.\n\nAbigail had arranged a meeting with the regulatory authority, something that would have undoubtedly placed Gregory in hot water.

A myriad of items were on display. Among them was a dagger that sat ominously in the glass showcase. It was undeniably similar to the one that was used to murder Abigail.\n\nWinston left the auction house with plenty to think about. He knew Abigail was onto Gregory. She had unearthed evidence linking him to fraudulent auctions in the past. But Gregory was a regular at the jazz club - it was part of his routine after a long day immersed in the busy and intense world of auctions. Winston walked away from the auction house, a stone's throw from the jazz club, ready to dive deeper into the case.\n\nWinston, the seasoned detective, walked into the jazz club where Abigail was found dead, her body marked by a wound that could've only been made by a dagger. The atmosphere of the place was still heavy with shock and sorrow. He took a walk around the club, scanning for anything that might offer valuable information.\n\nAs he waited for the club owner to gather the employees for him to interview, he scrolled through his phone, reading an article about Madelyn, a lawyer who specialized in high-conflict legal cases. It was said that due to her involvement in these cases, she had been the recipient of several threats from unknown people looking to intimidate her. \n\nHe spotted her in a few photos attending court late into the night, a stapled fact rising from the tarmac of her professional biography. The detective glanced at his wrist-watch, from her office to here it would have been less than a 10-minute ride; a fact that caught him off guard.\n\nMadelyn worked hard as a defense lawyer on a high-profile criminal case. Because of the nature of her work, she had been targeted in deleterious ways recently, including having her credit card information stolen. She was often at the office until late and regularly visited other parts of the city after dark for work.\n\nThe detective sifted through more news about her facing some financial peril: Madelyn’s credit card information theft was believed to be done to sabotage her work as a lawyer. On top of that, a major lawsuit was looming over her; the lawsuit Abigail was about to slam on her, which could result in financial ruin for the lawyer.\n\nHe came across another exciting piece of information. As a history enthusiast, Madelyn had an interesting hobby – she collected antique daggers, an interest that mirrored the punctured wound on Abigail and piqued Winston's curiosity.\n\nConnecting the dots, Madelyn wasn't just a common lawyer. The threats from unknown sources that tied to her high-conflict cases, her recent credit card theft, and the pending litigation from Abigail turned the situation into more than just a professional dilemma.\n\nAs the jazz club employees started filing into the room, Winston sat down in a corner, still staring at the screen of his phone, fixated on Madelyn, a top professional in her field, pressurized by unknown threats and a lawsuit that could spell financial doom.

{"doc_id": 87, "doc": {"narrative": "In the neon-lit labyrinth of a local jazz club, the melody of intrigue rises as Detective Winston interrogates Gregory and Madelyn following the fatal twist of a dagger finding home in Abigail's heart.\n\nWinston sat quietly, eyes closed as the melodic tunes of the jazz band echoed around the club. This was the last place Abigail had been alive, an exciting and lively jazz club just around the block from the auction house. Gregory often found solace in the live music after a long day of auctioneering.\n\nThis was not exactly how Winston had pictured an auctioneer — the eccentric hairstyles and the ever-changing eye color almost seemed out of place. It was a trendy hair salon, where Gregory was seen frequently, the very place where he picked up the hottest hairstyle every week.\n\nAs the auction closed, Gregory was seen stepping out from the auction house appearing somewhat relieved. Revenge in the air as Abigail had been on the edge of revealing a secret that would cripple Gregory's career as an auctioneer forever. The quiet murmurs of the patrons in the auction hall only escalating the tension.\n\nWinston ventured towards the auction house the following day. As the day turned into evening, Gregory arrived carrying a small bag. He was approached by the security guard who nodded in recognition, allowing the auctioneer inside with no questions asked. So, Gregory indeed had access to the auction house and its collections after hours.\n\nWinston found himself hovering around the dagger collection. One in particular caught his eye, it was remarkably similar to the one used to murder Abigail. Gregory had auctioned a similar one on the night of the murder. \n\nHe contemplated this later walking down the street, passing a storefront when something caught his eye. It was a small shop selling colored contacts. Looking at the CCTV footage, Winston recognized Gregory purchasing some colored contacts at the store. And just like his trendy hairstyles, Gregory's eye color seemed to change every few days. \n\nAs the evening deepened, Gregory was seen leaving the auction house and stepping into the jazz club. The same sequence of events that had taken place on the night of Abigail's murder. \n\n\"Mister Gregory, can I have a word with you?\" Winston approached the auctioneer later that night, finding him in the dimly lit jazz club. Gregory accepted with a nod.\n\n\"So, you're a frequenter, I heard?\" Winston made lighthearted conversation.\n\n\"Only after each auction, detective.\" Gregory answered coolly. No signs of guilt, only a man enjoying his evening with his familiar jazz music.\n\n\"Must be nice, being an auctioneer, seeing all sorts of precious things come and go.\"\n\nGregory chuckled, \"Quite so, detective. Keeps the job exciting.\"\n\n\"And the jazz club, just around the corner. Convenient, isn't it?”\n\n“Indeed,” Gregory concluded cryptically. Winston left him at that, gathering his coat and calling it a night. There was some catching up to do and a murderer to catch.\n\nWinston turned the crime scene photos over and over in his mind. The jazz club was bustling, alive with music, laughter, and the chatter of living souls. Between the shadowy saxophone player and the wisps of smoky haze, the rolling melodies echoed cries for the one lost – Abigail.\n\nWinston sighed and rose from his chair, reaching for his coat. In one corner of the crime scene picture, a glimmering dagger caught his eye, a seemingly misplaced relic amidst the modern jazz club surroundings. With an imminent late-night visit to the scene, he prepared for his encounter with Madelyn.\n\nArriving at Madelyn's office after her return from a late-night meeting across town, he waited patiently as she packed her files into a briefcase, still working after a long day. \n\n\"Busy day?\" He asked, glancing at her overflowing case. \n\n\"Always is, Detective - high-conflict cases aren't known for their simplicity. Goes with the territory I suppose, and constant travelling to take care of these cases, of course,\", she sighed, heaving her bag onto her shoulder and motioning for Winston to follow her towards the elevator. \n\nIn the limbo between floors, Winston studied Madelyn. The fine lines creasing her forehead and the dull tiredness in her eyes spoke volumes of late nights in the office and constant travelling. \n\n\"Coffee?\" She asked, sitting heavily into her chair in the dimly lit room, motioning to a nearby coffee pot. \n\n\"No thanks, just want to be clear on some things,\" Winston said, refusing the siren call of caffeine. \n\n\"On that dagger incident, you mean? It's an antique from my collection. Some kind of sick joke, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Niche hobby, isn't it?\" Winston remarked calmly.\n\n\"History unfolds with every piece from the past – it's actually quite intriguing if you take the time to dive in,\" she replied, looking beyond Winston into her past with a distant gaze.\n\nConversation shifted to the late Abigail with a heavy tone, feeling more like a performance than genuine grief. Madelyn bitterly explained how the two of them used to be good friends until they fell out over a huge debt she unfortunately borrowed from Abigail. \n\n\"She was threatening to drag me to the court and make my debt public... Just imagine the public humiliation, \" she confessed with a shake of the head, her eyes reflecting a mixture of resentment and fear. \"And let’s not forget that winning lawsuit could’ve spelled financial ruin for me. It terrified me.\"\n\nIn the quiet of her office, the soft ticking of the clock echoed with each second. The room absorbed her words, casually dancing around the real question Winston was going to ask. Just as he was about to probe further, a distant melody caught his ear. The melody spelt jazz and Madelyn noticed his interest.\n\n\"The club? Oh, it's just about 10 minutes from here.

{"doc_id": 89, "doc": {"narrative": "On a night when the roar of go-karts was silenced by a nefarious deed, Detective Winston finds himself investigating the peculiar murder of Gary, slain by a rarely-seen sai with two unlikely suspects: Frederick and Jerome.\n\nWinston furrowed his brow as he flipped through the case file. Jeremiah, the previous go-kart champion, was found dead at the very track he'd dominated for years. Gary, undefeated and the current champion, had been a massive hurdle for those competing, especially for his rival Jerome, who always seemed to take the second place.\n\nAn eyebrow-raising detail caught Winston's attention, Gary's keys to his office had been reported missing and unaccounted for.  The reports had indicated that a driving instructor by the name of Jerome was the last person to leave Gary's office the day his keys went missing. Winston had also found it strange that Jerome controlled the go-kart track's schedule.\n\nBesides driving instruction, Jerome also seemed to indulge in a martial art form. An impressive certificate of martial arts mastery hung on the walls of his office.\n\nWinston heard rumors of sustained tension between Gary and Jerome. Apparently, they had a history of contentious races, with Gary's supremacy hindering Jerome's chances at first place. Gary had recently accused Jerome of cheating in the last race, leading to a major dispute.\n\nUnusually, a week before the murder, Jerome was seen purchasing multiple sai—a weapon Winston was familiar with from martial arts movies. Some top-drawer receipts from Jerome's office confirmed these purchases. Additionally, he was spotted practicing with the sai at a local gym, following his regular fight moves workout, fueling the mystery.\n\nJerome's passion for go-karting was immense, and as the track's driving instructor, he was deeply involved in all activities. This involvement granted him unrestricted access to most track areas, including Gary's office. \n\nAt the track itself, Winston decided to question Jerome. He found Jerome instructing a group of novice drivers.\n\n\"Jerome?\" asked Winston.\n\n\"That's me,\" replied Jerome, turning around. His gloves showed signs of frequent use. He appeared to be a hands-on instructor.\n\n\"You were close with Gary, I take it?\" \n\n\"He was a tough competitor, but we knew each other on the track,\" said Jerome.\n\n\"His dominance in every race must have been troublesome for you, especially after he accused you of cheating in the last one. The fact that his keys are missing and you were the last person to leave his office must be another troubling circumstance for you.\"\n\nJerome sighed, “It was his word against mine. But yes, it added more tension to our already strained relationship.”\n\nWinston thanked Jerome for his time and decided to dig deeper into this mystery, leaving the sounds of roaring engines and the smell of burning rubber behind.\n\nDetective Winston elegantly stepped out of his car, looking from side to side at the quiet go-kart track. Tire tracks were sketched over the quiet go-kart track. Despite the glaze of the late night, the sight oozed with an unexpected eeriness: the phantom-like go-karts parked neatly, the silent squeal of the rubber tires on the cement track, and the absence of the usual laughter, all seemed abnormal given the facts. It was much later for Frederick, the dock worker, who not only could be spotted at the track frequently, even into the late hours of the previous night, but had been spotted there exceptionally late on the murder day.\n\nConversational whispers echoed among the locals recently. Frederick, it turned out, had been confronting others about their unsolicited interactions with his beloved go-kart. The sight of his kart, now still and silent unlike its usual roar, coupled with the deafening quietness of the night ran chill down Winston's spine. He couldn't shake off the echoes of a recent dispute Frederick had here, not when his racing schedule strangely aligned perfectly with the murder time. And the off hours, serving less crowds, made it an ideal time for Frederick to get some of his responsibilities done, like inventory management and safety checks.\n\nWinston moved towards a small office adjacent to the track. Opening the door, the room was not much larger than a closet with a couple of cabinets, a coat rack, and a table; provisions neatly stacked.

{"doc_id": 91, "doc": {"narrative": "In the shimmering depths of a popular scuba diving site, Julian's life was brutally extinguished with a crowbar; now, it's up to Detective Winston to dive into the murky secrets of suspects Lucy and Clara.\n\nDetective Winston sat in his office, massaging his temples as he rifled through files. Information was abundant—the murder of Julian, committed at a scuba diving site, the involvement of a certain piece of equipment, a crowbar, and a suspect, Lucy, passenger on the same boat. The friend of the deceased, they dived together often, and the current dive was only meant for a small group, to which Lucy and Julian had belonged. It was interesting, how close they were, especially after Lucy found evidence of Julian's planned betrayal in his belongings, causing her significant harm. Moreover, Lucy mentioned how she was privy to Julian discussing his betrayal with another person while on their diving trips.\n\nGlancing at the clock, Winston grabbed his jacket from the back of his chair.\n\nHe arrived outside of Lucy's house. The lights were dim, and music softly drifted out from a cracked window. John's house stood adjacent, a zoo of life contrasting the quietly serene ambiance of Lucy's yard.\n\nWinston knocked, waiting patiently before being greeted by a man whose tired eyes glinted suspiciously. \"Lucy allows you inside?\" he queried.\n\nWinston nodded, \"Yes, she said she will be available.\"\n\nJohn, a night-worker, usually checked his surroundings before heading to bed. From his window, one had a clear view of Lucy's house. Winston made a mental note of it before he walked towards her porch light's glow.\n\nInside, Lucy cleared her throat, \"I'm usually in bed by nine, but you're welcome to stay. Would you like something to drink, detective?\" \n\n\"No, thank you,\" He responded, letting his gaze move over the room.\n\nThrough their conversation, it became clear that Lucy didn't have any reason, such as work, to stay awake past her aforementioned bedtime.  \n\nWinston tilted his head slightly, \"You and Julian were part of a small group?\"\n\nLucy nodded and mumbled, \"Yes. We used to dive together frequently. Julian always kept his gear in the locker room.\"\n\n\"And you had the privilege to access?\" Winston inquired.\n\nShe affirmed with a nod. \"I was the only person allowed in his locker.\"\n\nWinston chose not to reply. Instead, he excused himself and took his leave.\n\nWinston went over the evening in his head as he drove away, the mysterious irony of it all playing out before him. The pieces of puzzle were there, scattered but there, ready to be joined. But the one making the most noise was this— Julian's past actions causing harm to Lucy, his subsequent betrayal, and Lucy being privy to it all due to her overhearing his discussions.\n\nTrust is a fragile thing—it takes years to build but seconds to break.\n\nDetective Winston strolled into the bustling office of the metalworking company where the late Julian worked alongside Clara, the latter now under investigation. Clara had been spotted precariously securing her distinctive metalwork, a crowbar, into her car before the tragic dive. Professionalism must remain paramount in such situations, Winston mused, pushing aside the chilling imagery.\n\nAs he reached Julia's workstation, the evidence of her being a workaholic was quite evident. Work was stacked high, along with diving gear stowed in the corner. \"Talented and hardworking,\" Winston mused aloud, making his way to Clara's workspace. Like Julian's, it too was littered with stacks of unfinished work and abandoned tools, a testament of long work hours put into recent projects which, as Winston recalled, Clara had excelled at. \n\nSpotting a few unique pieces, introspective in their design, he overheard a couple of coworkers mentioning Clara's passion and drive, specifically mentioning her enthusiasm at the prospect of obtaining an upcoming promotion. The same promotion, Winston gathered, that both Julia and Clara were contenders for.\n\nThinking through the additional information he had received that Clara was part of the ill-fated diving team, he realized that it made perfect sense. Clara was a known scuba diving enthusiast, something she had in common with Julia. They’d both been scheduled to dive at the same time and location on that fateful day, with Clara volunteering to inspect the equipment.\n\nConsidering these observations, Winston ventured out to the diving site where the incident occurred. He arrived to find the rest of the diving team scouting the area. His presence was duly noted; however, he kept his distance, choosing to observe.\n\nWith the day drawing to a close, Winston had more questions than answers, the clues gathering like puzzle pieces, their fit still untested. Winston had learned that in investigation, not everything was as it appeared, and this case proved no different. It was an intricate tapestry woven with ambition, passion, and an undefined, potentially fatal error.

But the one making the most noise was this\\u2014 Julian's past actions causing harm to Lucy, his subsequent betrayal, and Lucy being privy to it all due to her overhearing his discussions.\\n\\nTrust is a fragile thing\\u2014it takes years to build but seconds to break.\\n\\nDetective Winston strolled into the bustling office of the metalworking company where the late Julian worked alongside Clara, the latter now under investigation. Clara had been spotted precariously securing her distinctive metalwork, a crowbar, into her car before the tragic dive. Professionalism must remain paramount in such situations, Winston mused, pushing aside the chilling imagery.\\n\\nAs he reached Julia's workstation, the evidence of her being a workaholic was quite evident. Work was stacked high, along with diving gear stowed in the corner. \\\"Talented and hardworking,\\\" Winston mused aloud, making his way to Clara's workspace. Like Julian's, it too was littered with stacks of unfinished work and abandoned tools, a testament of long work hours put into recent projects which, as Winston recalled, Clara had excelled at. \\n\\nSpotting a few unique pieces, introspective in their design, he overheard a couple of coworkers mentioning Clara's passion and drive, specifically mentioning her enthusiasm at the prospect of obtaining an upcoming promotion. The same promotion, Winston gathered, that both Julia and Clara were contenders for.\\n\\nThinking through the additional information he had received that Clara was part of the ill-fated diving team, he realized that it made perfect sense. Clara was a known scuba diving enthusiast, something she had in common with Julia. They\\u2019d both been scheduled to dive at the same time and location on that fateful day, with Clara volunteering to inspect the equipment.\\n\\nConsidering these observations, Winston ventured out to the diving site where the incident occurred. He arrived to find the rest of the diving team scouting the area. His presence was duly noted; however, he kept his distance, choosing to observe.\\n\\nWith the day drawing to a close, Winston had more questions than answers, the clues gathering like puzzle pieces, their fit still untested. Winston had learned that in investigation, not everything was as it appeared, and this case proved no different. It was an intricate tapestry woven with ambition, passion, and an undefined, potentially fatal error. The challenging part was to unravel it without causing more harm than had already been done.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Lucy\\n(b) - Clara\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(a) - Lucy"]], "filtered_resps": ["(a)"], "doc_hash": "129e64f35edb906c8c21dd0405d1c6162b96aacdffe1f1673a1adcdd520c84de", "prompt_hash": "dee04656dc330a1be540c8d439bc4334ec0dcabeb367dd1d4c609f91d4c2e671", "target_hash": "f89bf797c3b1dda4ee48380783e5e979067686a6a9540c5a40e8d75ae5f3d199", "exact_match": 1.0}

{"doc_id": 94, "doc": {"narrative": "In the eerie glow of a laser tag arena, Nelson's life tragically ended with an axe, leaving Detective Winston to navigate a web of deception spun by suspects Mackenzie and Erika.\n\nWinston had barely blinked since he started pouring over the case files. Nelson, the financial auditor, was found murdered at a laser tag arena of all places, and the murder weapon: an axe. This was far from the norm and even stranger was the timing of the murder, coinciding with a laser tag game Nelson had been participating in.\n\nThe local PD had brought in Mackenzie for questioning. Winston noted she wore an expensive watch, as did Nelson. Seems they had more in common than he had first thought.\n\nWinston entered the interrogation room. Mackenzie didn't look up. He started off the conversation as casually as possible.\n\n\"Heard you and Nelson went to play laser tag that very day,\" Winston asked, with a neutral expression.\n\n\"Yeah,\" answered Mackenzie, \"He wanted to blow off some steam after working all day.\"\n\n\"Work must've been tough. Big pressure in the audit department,\" said Winston, maintaining his tone.\n\n\"A lot of discrepancies for sure,\" Mackenzie replied, her voice a tad more serious this time.\n\nInteresting. Winston remembered Nelson had filed a complaint about anomalies with the funds in the company. He had to change the course of the enquiry slightly.\n\n\"I've heard they have some pretty secluded areas in these laser tag arenas. You were spotted heading into one of them shortly before the game during which Nelson was murdered, Mackenzie,\" said Winston, watching her face closely. She took a deep breath before speaking again.\n\n\"I used to work as a lumberjack. I got used to the quiet, you know?\" she responded, her eyes never leaving his. \"Used to throw axes in college as part of a sport, so I also went into those areas to relax when I had time between games.\"\n\nTaking a pause himself, Winston said, \"And this axe you've recently been seen with?\"\n\n\"I took it with me that day,\" she admitted without hesitation. \"Thought some kids might like to see some tricks. Used to show 'em off back in my lumberjack days.\"\n\nWinston nodded, \"You certainly know how to handle one.\"\n\nSuddenly, Winston's phone buzzed with a message. He skimmed through the contents and glanced up at Mackenzie again, now studying her expensive accessories.\n\n\"Mackenzie, you made several large cash deposits recently,\" Winston said, still casual, \"Uncommon for your pay grade, no?\"\n\nA flash of a defensive posture wasn't lost on Winston. But the room remained silent except for his ensuing words.\n\n\"Well, we can get to that later,\" Winston said standing up and walking to the door, \"Take care, Mackenzie.\"\n\nShe nodded, her eyes now transfixed at the solitary light bulb above her.\n\nAfter leaving the room, Winston exhaled a deep breath. He felt a strange energy from Mackenzie...an air of danger and desperation. But he had to stick to the facts, and the facts alone. Destiny, it seemed, had led him down an unusual path indeed.\n\nWinston studied the crime scene report from the laser tag arena. Nelson was the victim this time. His eyebrows narrowed as he looked at the weapon of question - an axe. Quite a strange telling for such a place.\n\nThe next part of Winston’s day led him to Erika, Nelson's travel companion and a former lumberjack champion by trade. Erika was neither surprised by the detective or the fact he wanted to discuss Nelson's demise.\n\n\"Erika and Nelson entered the arena together and you were with him the entire time...,\" he asked in a questioning manner.\n\n\"Yes detective, Nelson and I both arrived together and I never left his side until...,\" she replied in a collected voice.\n\n\"An axe in a laser tag arena...,\" Winston sighed under his breath. Erika's ears seemed to pick on this and she acknowledged the odd presence of the tool.\n\n\"Yes, Detective... I noticed that toolbox. I even commented to Nelson about the axe inside it\". Her lumberjack past echoed slightly in her voice as she spoke.\n\nShe didn't hide that she exhibited high axe-wielding skills - a fact that was common knowledge in her home town. She won numerous lumberjack competitions, after all.\n\nDuring his investigation, Winston also found that Erika had a habit of using a VPN when browsing the internet, and that she cleared her browsing history after each session. He had to smile at this. In an age when everyone displayed their lives on social media, Erika's avoidance of the platform was quite unique. It was something Winston astutely noticed.\n\nConfirming this observation was Gerald, a companion on their recent travel. \"Erika, she's rather private when it comes to the internet.

Nelson, the financial auditor, was found murdered at a laser tag arena of all places, and the murder weapon: an axe. This was far from the norm and even stranger was the timing of the murder, coinciding with a laser tag game Nelson had been participating in.\\n\\nThe local PD had brought in Mackenzie for questioning. Winston noted she wore an expensive watch, as did Nelson. Seems they had more in common than he had first thought.\\n\\nWinston entered the interrogation room. Mackenzie didn't look up. He started off the conversation as casually as possible.\\n\\n\\\"Heard you and Nelson went to play laser tag that very day,\\\" Winston asked, with a neutral expression.\\n\\n\\\"Yeah,\\\" answered Mackenzie, \\\"He wanted to blow off some steam after working all day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Work must've been tough. Big pressure in the audit department,\\\" said Winston, maintaining his tone.\\n\\n\\\"A lot of discrepancies for sure,\\\" Mackenzie replied, her voice a tad more serious this time.\\n\\nInteresting. Winston remembered Nelson had filed a complaint about anomalies with the funds in the company. He had to change the course of the enquiry slightly.\\n\\n\\\"I've heard they have some pretty secluded areas in these laser tag arenas. You were spotted heading into one of them shortly before the game during which Nelson was murdered, Mackenzie,\\\" said Winston, watching her face closely. She took a deep breath before speaking again.\\n\\n\\\"I used to work as a lumberjack. I got used to the quiet, you know?\\\" she responded, her eyes never leaving his. \\\"Used to throw axes in college as part of a sport, so I also went into those areas to relax when I had time between games.\\\"\\n\\nTaking a pause himself, Winston said, \\\"And this axe you've recently been seen with?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I took it with me that day,\\\" she admitted without hesitation. \\\"Thought some kids might like to see some tricks. Used to show 'em off back in my lumberjack days.\\\"\\n\\nWinston nodded, \\\"You certainly know how to handle one.\\\"\\n\\nSuddenly, Winston's phone buzzed with a message. He skimmed through the contents and glanced up at Mackenzie again, now studying her expensive accessories.\\n\\n\\\"Mackenzie, you made several large cash deposits recently,\\\" Winston said, still casual, \\\"Uncommon for your pay grade, no?\\\"\\n\\nA flash of a defensive posture wasn't lost on Winston. But the room remained silent except for his ensuing words.\\n\\n\\\"Well, we can get to that later,\\\" Winston said standing up and walking to the door, \\\"Take care, Mackenzie.\\\"\\n\\nShe nodded, her eyes now transfixed at the solitary light bulb above her.\\n\\nAfter leaving the room, Winston exhaled a deep breath. He felt a strange energy from Mackenzie...an air of danger and desperation. But he had to stick to the facts, and the facts alone. Destiny, it seemed, had led him down an unusual path indeed.\\n\\nWinston studied the crime scene report from the laser tag arena. Nelson was the victim this time. His eyebrows narrowed as he looked at the weapon of question - an axe. Quite a strange telling for such a place.\\n\\nThe next part of Winston\\u2019s day led him to Erika, Nelson's travel companion and a former lumberjack champion by trade. Erika was neither surprised by the detective or the fact he wanted to discuss Nelson's demise.\\n\\n\\\"Erika and Nelson entered the arena together and you were with him the entire time...,\\\" he asked in a questioning manner.\\n\\n\\\"Yes detective, Nelson and I both arrived together and I never left his side until...,\\\" she replied in a collected voice.\\n\\n\\\"An axe in a laser tag arena...,\\\" Winston sighed under his breath. Erika's ears seemed to pick on this and she acknowledged the odd presence of the tool.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Detective... I noticed that toolbox. I even commented to Nelson about the axe inside it\\\". Her lumberjack past echoed slightly in her voice as she spoke.\\n\\nShe didn't hide that she exhibited high axe-wielding skills - a fact that was common knowledge in her home town. She won numerous lumberjack competitions, after all.\\n\\nDuring his investigation, Winston also found that Erika had a habit of using a VPN when browsing the internet, and that she cleared her browsing history after each session. He had to smile at this. In an age when everyone displayed their lives on social media, Erika's avoidance of the platform was quite unique. It was something Winston astutely noticed.\\n\\nConfirming this observation was Gerald, a companion on their recent travel. \\\"Erika, she's rather private when it comes to the internet. She stays away from social media, and I've seen her clear her browser history after each use,\\\" he noted in his conversation with Winston.\\n\\nHe found that confirmed by her college roommate as well. She blushed, then sheepishly said, \\\"Yeah, Erika never really cared for social media. She's always been a private person.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Erika, I find it quite peculiar that Nelson was found dead just minutes after you two entered the laser tag arena and were together,\\\" Winston finally expressed.\\n\\nErika's gaze shifted slightly at Winston\\u2019s last comment but she remained silent, her face a calm mask.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Mackenzie\\n(b) - Erika\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(a) - Mackenzie"]], "filtered_resps": ["(a)"], "doc_hash": "05ca3b8810ca60015995e840823764d55817b656c51acfd2d3262deebd89af83", "prompt_hash": "a23d43744ef2de567d4f179abd1c937087b50f2e137b2db1b98f8a777460041b", "target_hash": "e300f251dc09073a9781733cd99758d04a98290157b77fb5c4a986b123900fc6", "exact_match": 0.0}

He couldn't shake the eerie chill that the labyrinth had loaned him that morning.\n\nThe first break in the case came from an unexpected place, in the form of a casual chat with a local construction worker. According to the worker, Gary, who was often seen at construction sites due to his job, had been sighted there on the night of the murder. Gary, he noted, would always be seen with an iron bar in hand.\n\nWinston decided to visit Gary at one of the many construction sites he frequented, finding him overseeing the loading of materials onto a truck.\n\n\"It's hard work, Detective.\" Gary began in response to Winston's silent probing, \"But it's how the family business works.\"\n\n\"How about Rosemary, your stepmother, how did she fit into all this?\" Winston pried, recalling how Rosemary had been recently throwing herself into the family business.\n\nHer mention released a floodgate of bitterness in Gary's voice. \"Well, I reckon she wanted to ensure that the business continued to thrive.

This labyrinth had been a significant part of Gary's life; he had spent a lot of time here, and his involvement in its construction was evident. However, it was temporarily closed off to the public on the night of Rosemary's murder. Despite this, her body was found in its interior, beaten down with an iron bar.\n\nGary was the last person seen entering the labyrinth before the time of the murder, according to several witnesses. Since he was the victim's stepson, Winston knew interviewing him was paramount. It was a known fact that the relationship between Gary and his stepmother, Rosemary, was strained - increasingly so after she took a prominent role in the family business administration, a role in which he was majorly overlooked. Winston was interested to know how this resentment towards his stepmother's involvement in their family business might have played into the murder.\n\nJoining Gary, who was engrossed in his laptop, Winston greeted, \"Good evening.\" His greeting was returned with a grudging acknowledgment and a nervous glance towards the laptop. His friend had mentioned that Gary was an avid computer enthusiast - he would always be on his computer after returning from work, diving into the infinite realm that the internet offered, often late into the night. Every night.\n\nIt was this preference for the online world, his friend had noted, where Gary spent a significant amount of his time. \"Your friend tells me you're quite the computer enthusiast,\" Winston ventured, casually making a note of it. Gary's face immediately exhibited discomfort, confirming the hinted behavior.\n\nGary's friend had also mentioned, rather candidly, about multiple incidents where he'd walk into a room to find Gary hurriedly closing his laptop screen. Winston noticed this around the same time he hinted at Gary's online habits.\n\n\"And your stepmother, Rosemary,\" Winston continued, bringing the topic back to the victim. \"She had been part of all major business decisions recently, right?\" he asked intending to stir something out of Gary's resentment.\n\nGary's reply was curt, and while it revealed nothing definite, it was enough for Winston to feel he was coursing along the right path of the mystery, \"Let's just say she fancied herself quite the boss.\"\n\nWinston glanced at the list of facts sprawled over the worn-out brown leather pad. The labyrinth murder of Rosemary was a conundrum he had never encountered in his long career as a detective. Among the suspects, Dale had been banging around in his mind. Architect by profession and by all means, a tough guy, Dale was a regular at the local gym. It was not everyday someone had the physique to swing around an iron bar, let alone kill with it. Furthermore, he had worked on previous projects involving the use of iron bars, a detail Winston considered notable. Dale had even bragged about his strength while lifting these heavy construction materials at one of his projects when the detective had visited as part of his routine checks.\n\nSpeaking of which, the labyrinth was not just any project for Dale. He had full control over its design and construction. Doesn't a spider know its own web the best, Winston mused.\n\nHe reopened the forensic report of Rosemary. The images of her visible bruises were a grim reminder of a dark side to Dale, one few knew. A domestic dispute or two may not prove anything, but loud, recurring arguments heard by neighbors indicated a line had been crossed again and again.\n\nWinston thumbed through the pages and a couple of crucial facts jumped out, once again. Dale had been fighting for the custody of kids.

The sight of the young boy stretched out lifeless in the woodland was an image too jarring to easily forget.\n\nDropping his files onto the table, Winston decided to visit the scene of the crime, the local campground where Ernest and many others had gathered for a large party. As Winston walked around the now abandoned campsite, he noticed a few items left behind by the careless partygoers. It was here Ernest had been found, brutally murdered with a crowbar. \n\nAddison, a classmate of Ernest and a regular at the campsite, had been present on the day of the murder. Winston had his eye on him, based on the information he'd received. \n\nNext, Winston decided to pay Addison a visit at his place of work. As an apprentice mechanic, Addison spent his days working hard in the garage, using a variety of tools. The garage was a mess of wrenches, screwdrivers, and yes, even a few crowbars. It seemed only natural for a mechanic to possess such tools.\n\n“Detective Winston. To what do I owe this pleasure?” Addison greeted him as he entered the garage, leisurely cleaning his hands with a rag.\n\nWinston showed his badge, “ Investigating the murder of Ernest.”\n\n“Yeah, very sad stuff,” Addison said sighing heavily. \"Ernie and I went way back. Even went camping together at the same site.\"\n\nDigging further into Addison's background, Winston found that this small-town mechanic apprentice was surprisingly also a scholar. He had been accepted, on scholarship, to a prestigious college based on his impressive grades.\n\nImpressive, unless you got wind that perhaps not all of his grades were honestly won. Winston found out that Addison indeed did cheat on a major exam. This was not unusual, save that Ernest knew about it and had threatened to go public, potentially jeopardizing the prestigious scholarship.\n\nAs Winston confined his investigation for the day, he couldn't help but remember what Addison had said, \"Getting that scholarship, it's my ticket out of this town,\" he had said. Then he’d paused, rubbing the back of his neck before adding sheepishly, \"It could be revoked though, if my grades were to suddenly drop.\" \n\nAnd so the day came to a close, and Winston was left with his thoughts. But something told him that this case was far from being resolved.\n\nDetective Winston rolled up to the police station for the task laid before him. Busy with daily hustle and tasks, it wasn't an unfamiliar sight, but today it felt unusual. He was at the station to interview one of the very ones who uphold the law – Octavia.\n\nApproaching her desk, he saw Octavia fiddling around with her phone before tucking it away hastily. Winston noticed her coworker attentively watching Octavia, before briefly meeting his eyes and offering a sheepish nod. \"I saw her deleting some of those social media apps off her phone this morning,\" the coworker whispered as Winston passed by him. He added quickly, \"I could recognize the logos before she removed them.\" \n\nTaking a seat by Octavia, Winston introduced himself, while subtly inspecting Octavia. She seemed alert and in control - typical traits of a trained officer. \n\nAfter a brief conversation about her duties, Winston asked, \"I hear you were on patrol last night?\" \n\n\"Yeah, I was,\" Octavia responded with a steady voice, maintaining eye contact with Winston.\n\n\"Did your route include the campgrounds?” Winston queried but Octavia was already nodding, her face passive.\n\nWinston, attempting to glean more from her body language, asked for a photograph of her for reference. \"I am afraid that's not possible,\" she responded tersely. \"I don’t allow photographs of me to be taken.

Moreover, he discovered a draft email on Ernest's phone, intended to be an expose of Octavia, indicating that Ernest was planning to reveal this secret.

Addison, the mechanic apprentice, was working under the car hood. He flipped through a book that was on a nearby table while working. Every time he paused to point out something in the room, like the faded motivational posters on the wall or the cozy layout of the waiting area, Winston chuckled. Addison always had an eye for room decor.\n\n\"Hard at work I see.\" Winston said, breaking the silence. \n\nAddison shut the book and turned to face him. \"The work never ends,\" he replied, looking Winston up and down. \n\n\"I hear you were at the same camping site as Ernest.

He'd developed a habit - one even his fellow students noticed during lunch breaks and in every class - of constantly looking around at different parts of the room. \n\nWinston noticed that tendency walked hand in hand with his need to stay busy, like a curious mind reaching for unknown boundaries. 'Just like him to always have his nose in a book even during lunch breaks', he thought.\n\n\"But it's not always just work and school, right?\" Winston asked. \"You also attend those parties out in the campground, yeah?\" There had been a big one on the night of the murder.\n\nAddison picked the book off the table and flipped through the pages, shrugging nonchalantly. \"Yeah, I was there. So was half the town. Doesn't mean I know anything about what happened to Ernest. That party was big, a lot could've happened.\"\n\nNext to Addison, Winston noticed an array of tools lined up on the workbench. Screwdrivers, hammers, and a crowbar among others, which was casually left on the side of the workbench. He'd seen Addison regularly with his work tools, it was part of being an apprentice.\n\n\"So, you're a mechanic apprentice, right?\" Winston asked. \"You work with these kinds of tools every day?\"\n\nAddison looked at him for a moment before nodding. \"That's right. It's my field of work. Handling tools like crowbars is just part of the job.\"\n\nWinston left Addison with his book and his workshop, making his way out to his car.\n\nCamping, tool handling, busy campgrounds... Winston had a lot to think about on the drive back to the station. But, as always, the detective knew better than to rush to any conclusions just yet. The only thing certain was that everyone he met added a new piece to the puzzle. That was the nature of his job, chasing the truth and sifting through the fragments of life his line of work offered him. Little by little, every witness, every suspect, and every victim told their own part of the story.\n\nWinston watched Octavia’s firm grip around her mug of lukewarm coffee. She was a sturdy woman, her experience in construction before joining the police force wasn't common knowledge, but it gave her that burly silhouette. He also knew that she had picked up a knack for handling construction tools, crowbars included, from her watch in the building business.\n\n\"Officer Octavia,\" started Winston, trying to appear casual, \"Officer 'tavia,\" he corrected himself, as per the way locals referred to her, \"you were on patrol the night Ernest was murdered, correct?\"\n\nHer gaze remained steady, not threatening nor hesitant, \"Yes, that would be right.\"\n\n\"Were the campgrounds along your route?\" asked Winston, knowing that he was treading on thin ice. The campgrounds which were part of her regular beat were also where poor Ernest was found dead.\n\n\"They sure were,\" she replied without diverting her gaze. \"I've patrolled there for years now.\"\n\nWinston pressed on, “Ernest, a known revealer of secrets, was threatening to leak his current findings. He'd uncovered an officer’s shady past and he claimed it was yours. Know anything about that?”\n\nOctavia just looked through him, her facial muscles taut as she remained stoic. \"Ernest was always digging around for information, but I can't say I do.\"\n\nStaying strategic, he continued, \"Ernest indicated that this officer with supposed shady practices was involved in illegal activities before joining the force. Oddly reminiscent of your own construction and police career, Octavia. Fearful of any skeletons in the closet that might be found?”\n\nHere, Octavia's mask seemed to crack, but just for a moment, \"I've no idea what you're implying.\"\n\nWinston chose his next words carefully, conscious of her legal knowledge, “Do you have access to a crowbar, officer Octavia?”\n\nShe let out a short laugh, a sarcastic retort forming on her lips, “Well, every police department has its set of tools, Winston. Are you implying because we have crowbars, we might be swinging them at the locals?”\n\nWinston remained silent, letting Octavia’s scoff hang in the air before speaking again. He gently changed the direction of his questions, “During your patrol last night, did you happen to see anything out of ordinary at the camp?”\n\n“Just a quiet starry night, nothing too wild happening in my town, Winston.”\n\nAs the conversation winded up, Winston decided to leave Octavia with one last piece of thought, “Ernest had hinted at uncovering a cop's illegal past, may be yours. It does seem like there’s something you’d want to keep from the force.”\n\nFor the first time during their conversation, Octavia looked unsure. She shook her head, \"I couldn't tell you, Winston.\"\n\nAs an investigative officer himself, Winston knew the camaraderie among the police ranks. Tonight he’d heard enough. He’d got Octavia talking, about her quiet patrol night and the secret that she urgently seemed to want buried, and her past involvement in illegal activities.

She was a sturdy woman, her experience in construction before joining the police force wasn't common knowledge, but it gave her that burly silhouette. He also knew that she had picked up a knack for handling construction tools, crowbars included, from her watch in the building business.\\n\\n\\\"Officer Octavia,\\\" started Winston, trying to appear casual, \\\"Officer 'tavia,\\\" he corrected himself, as per the way locals referred to her, \\\"you were on patrol the night Ernest was murdered, correct?\\\"\\n\\nHer gaze remained steady, not threatening nor hesitant, \\\"Yes, that would be right.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Were the campgrounds along your route?\\\" asked Winston, knowing that he was treading on thin ice. The campgrounds which were part of her regular beat were also where poor Ernest was found dead.\\n\\n\\\"They sure were,\\\" she replied without diverting her gaze. \\\"I've patrolled there for years now.\\\"\\n\\nWinston pressed on, \\u201cErnest, a known revealer of secrets, was threatening to leak his current findings. He'd uncovered an officer\\u2019s shady past and he claimed it was yours. Know anything about that?\\u201d\\n\\nOctavia just looked through him, her facial muscles taut as she remained stoic. \\\"Ernest was always digging around for information, but I can't say I do.\\\"\\n\\nStaying strategic, he continued, \\\"Ernest indicated that this officer with supposed shady practices was involved in illegal activities before joining the force. Oddly reminiscent of your own construction and police career, Octavia. Fearful of any skeletons in the closet that might be found?\\u201d\\n\\nHere, Octavia's mask seemed to crack, but just for a moment, \\\"I've no idea what you're implying.\\\"\\n\\nWinston chose his next words carefully, conscious of her legal knowledge, \\u201cDo you have access to a crowbar, officer Octavia?\\u201d\\n\\nShe let out a short laugh, a sarcastic retort forming on her lips, \\u201cWell, every police department has its set of tools, Winston. Are you implying because we have crowbars, we might be swinging them at the locals?\\u201d\\n\\nWinston remained silent, letting Octavia\\u2019s scoff hang in the air before speaking again. He gently changed the direction of his questions, \\u201cDuring your patrol last night, did you happen to see anything out of ordinary at the camp?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cJust a quiet starry night, nothing too wild happening in my town, Winston.\\u201d\\n\\nAs the conversation winded up, Winston decided to leave Octavia with one last piece of thought, \\u201cErnest had hinted at uncovering a cop's illegal past, may be yours. It does seem like there\\u2019s something you\\u2019d want to keep from the force.\\u201d\\n\\nFor the first time during their conversation, Octavia looked unsure. She shook her head, \\\"I couldn't tell you, Winston.\\\"\\n\\nAs an investigative officer himself, Winston knew the camaraderie among the police ranks. Tonight he\\u2019d heard enough. He\\u2019d got Octavia talking, about her quiet patrol night and the secret that she urgently seemed to want buried, and her past involvement in illegal activities. As he left Octavia\\u2019s living room, he could not help but wonder more about this lady cop with a knack for using crowbars.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Addison\\n(b) - Octavia\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(b) - Octavia"]], "filtered_resps": ["(b)"], "doc_hash": "792e9566b6f7ac31010e4b53fa1c759aa620f31e04c9bc8498eea8dc8a9d9422", "prompt_hash": "53e5f6e2bc86316180c83695072197f08787042addc7c140a3c1442ff8c35639", "target_hash": "f89bf797c3b1dda4ee48380783e5e979067686a6a9540c5a40e8d75ae5f3d199", "exact_match": 0.0}

His house was a familiar blue building in the community. A nearby neighbor, busily mowing her lawn, waved a hearty hello.

He works there?\" \n\n\"Oh, yes! Maurice's been working there for years,\" the neighbor responded. \n\nWinston thanked her for the helpful information and made his way to the blue building.

It looked eerily familiar as it matched the description given by witnesses who claimed to have seen a similar paramedic's van parked in the desert on the day of Jerry's murder.\n\nRecalling a document he had gone through recently, Winston gathered that Maurice was due for trial soon. Allegedly, his former nurse had exposed him for unethical medical practices. If he was proven guilty, the consequence would be prison time. Coincidentally, the key witness in the malpractice case was none other than the recently departed, Jerry.\n\nLater, while in conversation with another nurse, Winston discovered that complaints about Maurice's professional ethics were not new. His patients, all former ones now, had lodged several complaints about him.\n\nExiting the hospital, Winston considered the revelations of the day. Despite the desert heat, a chill ran through him. He tactfully tapped the case file under his arm, knowing fully well that there was much to uncover in this investigation.\n\nDetective Winston squinted against the sunlight as he glanced towards the distant hills - the desert where Jerry was killed the night before. A desert that Winston knew served a dual purpose.

Jerry had been meeting him in this secluded spot to discuss these unique arrangements.\n\nWalking back to his vehicle through the bare, hot desert landscape, Winston started flipping through his notebook. The puzzle pieces were starting to form an alarming picture. Winston had discovered a hefty amount of money requested by Jerry from Rex, in return for his silence. With Jerry's meetings in the desert with Rex at his setup becoming more frequent, it was clear that Jerry was onto something big here.\n\nRex, the florist who owned that quirky flower shop and the adjacent tool supply store in town, had an apparent penchant for illicit activities. In his tool store, one could find all manner of gardening tools, even lead pipes, kept casually among the spades and hoes. Jerry's interest in Rex's store wasn't casual - Rex had been illegally importing exotic flowers, and Jerry had caught on. He even threatened to expose Rex's illegal activities, putting Rex's successful reputation as the owner of the renowned shop 'Blossoms & Thorns' in jeopardy.\n\nWhen Winston reached the town, he navigated through its narrow lanes and pulled into 'Blossoms & Thorns’. Looking around the shop, Winston noticed the impressive array of exotic flowers. Each one unique, each one illegally imported. These were the flowers that pulled a crowd, and they were also used in Rex's out-of-town flower arrangements that were prepared in the desert setup. The costs to bring these exotic flowers put Rex hugely in debt.\n\nWinston glanced at the large farming tools casually placed near Rex. There were spades, hoes, and lead pipes, each used frequently enough to blend in perfectly. Rex, with his impressive physical strength apparent from his ability to move large pots with ease, was used to handling these tools with no difficulty. But could he have used a lead pipe just as efficiently?\n\nAs Rex moved another pot, Winston brought up the topic nonchalantly - \"Flower-picking this morning, Rex?\" \n\nRex nodded, his attention clearly elsewhere, \"Yes, there are some fine native flowers out in the desert, particularly this time of year. I picked some for my out-of-town arrangements.\"\n\nStudying Rex, Winston knew all the signs were there - the lead pipe, the strength, the threats of exposure from Jerry, and the desperation of a man drowning in debt. Rex's weak reply hung heavy in the air - as did Winston's unsaid accusation. \n\n“Shame about Jerry though,” Winston said after a moment of silence.\n\nRex tensed, “Yes... real shame.” As if to forget the very thought, he turned around and continued working, his entire life revolving around a business that could cost him everything, including his respected reputation.

{"doc_id": 102, "doc": {"narrative": "In the dimly lit corners of a rundown motel, Jimmy's life was abruptly silenced by the ominous echo of a revolver, leaving Detective Winston with two enigmatic suspects - Isla, with her elusive charm, and Randy, the taciturn stranger.\n\nWinston sat in the dimly lit diner across from Randy, who was picking at his meal. Randy was a tall, thin man with a head of unruly hair, loosely holding onto a crushed, rather worn looking guitar pick. Seemed like a regular musician, but Winston knew that eyes can deceive. He started the conversation, coaxing out bits and pieces of Randy's most recent trials. \n\n\"Rumor has it you're having some trouble paying off loans, Randy,\" Winston ventured. \n\nThe musician looked up from his plate, setting his fork down. \"Yeah, you heard right,\" Randy confessed. \n\nWinston waited a beat, then asked, \"Got any other vices we should know about?\"\n\nRandy chuckled grimly. \"Well, I have a knack for getting my money into the wrong hands at the poker table.\"\n\nWinston nodded, making a note of it. Before moving onto the next subject, he specified, \"Got news yesterday - a revolver was found, identical to the one you were seen with at a music concert. It turned out to be the murder weapon.\" \n\nRandy paused and shrugged. \"Got it for protection. You never know who you might run into on the road. I only ever use it for shooting at the range.\"\n\nWhilst Randy was talking, Winston noticed the deep scars on Randy's fingers in the dim neon light. They were all identical in their presence, all etched with the same depth and characteristics. Being a man of detail, Winston asked Randy about them.\n\n\"Those?\" Randy looked at his hands with a sad laughter. \"Each scar on my hand came from a different guitar string breaking at a concert, all of them had a unique tale to tell,\" he said. Then he added, \"usual guitar injuries are just mere blisters, not deep scars like these. But what can I say? Bad luck follows me around\".\n\nWinston, though intrigued, refrained from reading anything into it. He then moved the conversation toward Randy's past interactions with the victim, the international hotel mogul, Jimmy.\n\n“So you knew Jimmy. The guy owned hotels from Tokyo to New York,” Winston stated.\n\n\"Jimmy, he loved his opulence. Always surrounded by luxury,\" Randy shrugged. \"Not that I ever got a slice of it, of course. I played in a few of his hotels... never got the invite to the penthouse.\" \n\nWinston thanked Randy for his time and left the diner. There were more aspects of this case to sniff out. All in a day’s work.\n\nDetective Winston sat across from Isla at the local coffee shop, the smell of burnt coffee wafting around them. \n\nIsla played less of a nervous suspect and leaned more into her usual friendly demeanor. Although they usually ran into each other at the gym, today's meetup was not about catching up on fitness routines. Just the other day, she had confessed to a friend on the treadmill beside her that she couldn't bear the blackmail from Jimmy anymore.\n\n\"Jimmy...he...he was blackmailing me, Detective Winston,\" Isla confessed, bleakly stirring her coffee. Her hopelessness was clear, something she had mentioned to her friends recently regarding the relentless blackmail. \n\nWinston didn't show his surprise. He just nodded and gestured for her to continue. \n\n\"We used to meet at a motel down the road. Crazy, right? But it was the only place we could talk without being seen. I was even there on the day of the murder,\" Isla confessed. That fact was uncovered in a police report which witnessed Isla at the motel on the day of Jimmy's murder.\n\nWinston knew this already, having received a report of Isla being spotted with Jimmy at the motel quite a few times in the past. He just grunted, encouraging her to keep speaking. \n\n\"It's not what you think. He...he took some photos...and threatened to expose them.\" Isla shuddered, her coffee cup rattling in her hand. \n\n\"Did you ever confront him about it?\" Winston asked, looking unwaveringly at Isla. \n\n\"Yes, I did! I couldn't stand it any longer, Detective. That day...the day he was killed...I was going to tell him it had to stop,\" Isla admitted, her voice raw with emotion. \n\n\"And then what happened?\" Winston asked, watching Isla's face carefully. \n\n\"I...I don't remember,\" Isla said, running a hand through her hair. \"I was so worked up. I just...I ended up at the shooting range. It helps...calm me down.\"\n\nWinston groaned internally on hearing this. Isla had been seen at the shooting range more often than not lately, supposedly to \"blow off some steam\".

But Isla shook her head, looking gloomy, and didn't say a word. \n\nWinston sighed and checked his watch.

Randy was a tall, thin man with a head of unruly hair, loosely holding onto a crushed, rather worn looking guitar pick. Seemed like a regular musician, but Winston knew that eyes can deceive. He started the conversation, coaxing out bits and pieces of Randy's most recent trials. \\n\\n\\\"Rumor has it you're having some trouble paying off loans, Randy,\\\" Winston ventured. \\n\\nThe musician looked up from his plate, setting his fork down. \\\"Yeah, you heard right,\\\" Randy confessed. \\n\\nWinston waited a beat, then asked, \\\"Got any other vices we should know about?\\\"\\n\\nRandy chuckled grimly. \\\"Well, I have a knack for getting my money into the wrong hands at the poker table.\\\"\\n\\nWinston nodded, making a note of it. Before moving onto the next subject, he specified, \\\"Got news yesterday - a revolver was found, identical to the one you were seen with at a music concert.

I only ever use it for shooting at the range.\\\"\\n\\nWhilst Randy was talking, Winston noticed the deep scars on Randy's fingers in the dim neon light. They were all identical in their presence, all etched with the same depth and characteristics. Being a man of detail, Winston asked Randy about them.\\n\\n\\\"Those?\\\" Randy looked at his hands with a sad laughter. \\\"Each scar on my hand came from a different guitar string breaking at a concert, all of them had a unique tale to tell,\\\" he said. Then he added, \\\"usual guitar injuries are just mere blisters, not deep scars like these. But what can I say? Bad luck follows me around\\\".\\n\\nWinston, though intrigued, refrained from reading anything into it. He then moved the conversation toward Randy's past interactions with the victim, the international hotel mogul, Jimmy.\\n\\n\\u201cSo you knew Jimmy. The guy owned hotels from Tokyo to New York,\\u201d Winston stated.\\n\\n\\\"Jimmy, he loved his opulence. Always surrounded by luxury,\\\" Randy shrugged. \\\"Not that I ever got a slice of it, of course.

Although they usually ran into each other at the gym, today's meetup was not about catching up on fitness routines. Just the other day, she had confessed to a friend on the treadmill beside her that she couldn't bear the blackmail from Jimmy anymore.\\n\\n\\\"Jimmy...he...he was blackmailing me, Detective Winston,\\\" Isla confessed, bleakly stirring her coffee. Her hopelessness was clear, something she had mentioned to her friends recently regarding the relentless blackmail. \\n\\nWinston didn't show his surprise. He just nodded and gestured for her to continue. \\n\\n\\\"We used to meet at a motel down the road. Crazy, right? But it was the only place we could talk without being seen.

The murder of Jimmy had taken him by surprise; the wealthy hotelier owned multiple hotels worldwide and was known for his love of high-end luxury, a stark contrast to the modest locale where he met his untimely demise.\n\nSlipping the photographs back into their manila envelope, Winston set his sights on his main person of interest, a guitarist named Randy. Not only was he seen at the motel the exact day Jimmy was killed, he was also seen entering Jimmy's room, a fact uncovered from an interrogation of motel guests as there were no CCTV cameras to corroborate their claims.

His exceptional dexterity, as he played the guitar, was quite noticeable.

What can I play for you?\" Randy asked, strumming a slow, bluesy riff.\n\n\"Actually, what I need isn't a song,\" Winston said, leaning in a little closer. \"A few folks saw you at Jimmy's room at the motel and you were also spotted with a revolver at a concert last month.

{"doc_id": 105, "doc": {"narrative": "In the chilling silence of a hockey rink, Marvin's life was brutally ended with a machete, leaving Detective Winston with two elusive suspects: Justin and Frederick.\n\nDetective Winston made his way through the bustling crowds at the local hockey rink. The place had a distinct, chilling atmosphere today, the murder of Marvin casting a grim shadow over it.\n\nHe spotted Justin not too far away, watching the game with a fixed expression. Justin had been noticeably depressed since a particular event - he had once proposed to Marvin's fiancé, expressing his undying love, only to be mercilessly rejected. After this incident, he was never quite the same, living with a constant air of despair and refusal to engage with happiness.\n\n\"Justin,\" Winston called out, making his way over. As soon as Justin heard the detective's approach and caught sight of the man in uniform, his eyes instantly lit up, always eager to gain more information about the crime.\n\n\"Detective,\" Justin greeted, his expression somber, yet subtly eager, \"here for the game or here about the recent crime?\"\n\nWinston raised a brow. Justin seemed too interested. \"Any hockey fan would be here for the game,\" he replied, \"Marvin was going to play, wasn't he?\"\n\nJustin's dry eyes took on a spark when the murder was mentioned again. He looked dejected at the mention of Marvin, but nodded, \"Yeah, he was. I was here to watch it.\" He had been with the crowd entering the hockey rink at the time of the murder, ready for the game and totally unprepared for the tragedy that eventually unfolded.\n\nHe paused, glancing around the rink, then asked, \"Do you know how they got in? The murderer, I mean.\"\n\nWinston kept his expression unreadable, but he noted Justin's quick change of topic back to the crime. \"Through the main entrance,\" he stated simply, \"like anyone else,\" he added, reaffirming that Justin had entered the same way.\n\n\"And the time... when exactly did it happen?\" Justin changed the topic right back to the crime again, the flame in his eyes burning brighter at the prospect of new details.\n\nWinston frowned slightly, \"During the game,\" he answered, watching Justin's face carefully. He appeared unphased.\n\nJustin cocked a brow, excitement mixed with intrigue evident in his lit eyes. \"I was here during that time,\" he pointed out, \"Watching the game.\"\n\nWinston nodded, \"You were, and as far as anyone knows, you didn't leave until well after,\" he almost sighed, \"Listen Justin, what exactly is it with you and this crime? It seems that you're more interested in it than the hockey game.\"\n\nJustin shifted, looking anywhere but at him, \"Well, it's just...Marvin and his fiancé, you know. I just thought they...weren't right for each other. I had a talk with her once. I asked her not to marry him. But she didn't listen.\"\n\nA sudden clang of a puck hitting the net caught their attention, but Winston kept his gaze on Justin, watching, and listening. There was a lot more to this case than meets the eye, he knew. However, his interview with Justin had just ended, leaving him with more questions than answers.\n\nThe harsh, industrial lighting of the hockey rink painted a grave picture as Detective Winston surveyed the crime scene. The rink's security tapes corroborated Frederick's presence at the scene, even capturing a heated argument between him and Marvin. In this particular argument, Marvin was heard threatening harm to Frederick's defenceless daughter. Frederick, a curator of a local weapons museum, also held a job at the hockey rink, giving him a valid reason for being there.\n\nSetting that evidence aside, Winston trotted towards the museum, a place Frederick frequented due to his love for antique machetes. Frederick had the responsibility of overseeing the unique collection of blades, his dedication emanating as bright as the lights above the collection.\n\nWhat piqued Winston's interest though was that one of the machetes in Frederick's collection matched the description of the weapon that ended Marvin's life. Such violent usage of a machete aligned with Marvin's previous harmful behavior; aggressive threats and unbidden visits to the girls' locker room only added to the growing list of his offensive conduct. After obtaining the necessary legal papers, Winston re-examined the machetes, concluding the lethal weapon indeed came from Frederick's collection.\n\nTaking a break from the museum, Detective Winston investigated Frederick further by questioning those who knew him. His protective behavior for his daughter was a common topic, supported further by a chilling detail given by a coworker in the hockey rink's locker rooms.\n\n\"Marvin once threatened Frederick's girl.

The murder of Howard wasn't a simple case. Howard, a workaholic, often spent late hours alone in his home office. This detail was well-known among the local community, and was confirmed by his visibly lit office window at night. Night after night, the sensor lights in Priscilla's driveway snapped on. The neighbor's dog howling in protest was a nightly routine in that silent suburb.

Her familiarity with the layout of Howard's house was apparent as she effortlessly guided Winston through the house, talking about her frequent visits to this place.\n\nWinston noted down her tidbits, like how she used to be involved in some criminal activities involving barbed wire.

{"doc_id": 107, "doc": {"narrative": "When Howard was found dead in his home office, strangled by a coil of barbed wire, it fell to Detective Winston to sift through lies of the prime suspects: Eric and Priscilla.\n\nWinston sighed as he glanced at the report of the latest murder. Howard, killed in his home office, and with barbed wire of all things. Admittedly, he wasn't an animal lover, but the fact the murderer was brazen enough to use something like that was unnerving.\n\nGetting out of his car, he approached the home of his latest suspect, Eric. A pet groomer by trade, who Howard had hired frequently to look after his pets. The peculiar thing about Eric was not only that he used barbed wire to fence the more adventurous pets in check, but that he always carried his work tools, barbed wire included, to his clients' homes. \n\nA neighbor had once mentioned how often he'd seen Eric hauling his grooming tools to his van, barbed wire coils included, and he frequently overheard the sound of water running from Eric's place, leading to reports of an unusually high water bill for Eric last month. The bill was discussed by the locals, and how this pet groomer used a lot of water in his duties wasn't lost on them.\n\nWinston knocked on the door, greeted by a man with sincere eyes and the faint smell of animal shampoo.\n\n“You're Eric, right?” said Winston.\n\n“That’s correct” the man replied with a friendly smile.\n\n\"And you groom pets, correct?\" Winston continued.\n\n\"That's right. I love animals. Even work with barbed wire to keep the more... adventurous ones in check. People in the neighborhood could tell you that. My next-door neighbor always sees me taking my work tools, including the wire, to my clients' homes and he hears the water running as well. You know, cause of bathing and grooming.\"\n\n“Hmm,...\" Winston hummed, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. \"You ever work at Howard's place?\"\n\n“Of course!\" Eric exclaimed quickly. \"Known him, his fiancee Gloria, and his pets for a while now. Have them on top of my customer list, along with a large number of other cat and dog owners.”\n\n“Gloria?” Winston probed.\n\nEric's face flushed, “Yes, I've known her for years, almost ten now. I visit her often for work, and...”\n\n\"Anything else about Gloria?\" Winston interrupted.\n\nEric paused for a moment before responding, “She’s special, Gloria. Kind to everything and everyone, she often showed me signs of warmth and kindness.\"\n\nAs Winston observed Eric, he noticed a notebook lying open on a nearby table. Flipping to the appointments section, he found a number of entries for cat and dog owners, confirming Eric's busy schedule. One page, however, caught his attention: a diary page with 'I love Gloria' written numerous times, speaking volumes about Eric's feelings for her.\n\n\"Thank you for your time, Eric,\" Winston finally said. As he headed towards the door, he turned and asked, \"Howard's office, fur on the barbed wire used?\"\n\nEric nodded. \"Yes, found it quite odd. Normally, I only groom pets in their homes.\"\n\nExiting the home, he made his way back to his car, a new collection of information swirling in his head. Winston had an uneasy feeling about this Eric. He made a mental note to have Eric’s diary and customer list with a number of cat and dog owners entered into evidence. There were a lot of dots to connect and they seemed to be dancing around in his head.\n\nThe blaring sirens came to a halt as Winston arrived at where the latest gruesome killing had taken place. Howard, a man who liked his quiet and often threw himself into work, found dead in his home office. According to initial reports, the murder weapon seemed to be a strand of barbed wire. Winston proceeded towards the crime scene, trying to keep his senses sharp to any clues he might find.\n\nPriscilla was a person of interest in the case. Tied to a string of crimes that included the use of barbed wire, she seemed more suspicious with every detail. Winston would be remiss if he didn't get all the facts about her lined up and ready. Priscilla, an ex-military personnel, stood out for her lack of an alibi during the time of murder. Winston made a note to conduct a thorough interrogation.\n\nWhile going over the diagrams and photos of the scene, Winston found that Howard's property was surrounded by barbed wire fences. An odd detail to his suburban house. Witnesses - the neighbors- reported seeing Priscilla's car on multiple occasions, and explicitly during the time of the murder, at the fenced property. A regular visitor, it seemed. Priscilla had no alibi, and knew the layout of the house well.\n\nHoward, always a reserved man, chose to spend lengthy hours alone in his home office. The numerous sightings of Priscilla at his house during these late work hours, and decisively at the time of murder, intrigued Winston. These were little crumbs, but they pointed Winston in a strong direction.\n\nWinston pulled Priscilla in for questioning; she was not an easy nut to crack. She had a history, pervasions into criminal activities that increased her confidence in her ability to avoid capture. Murmurings of previous killings involving barbed wire whirled around her, and each successful kill reportedly fed her sense of power and precision.\n\nWinston’s revelations grew more unnerving when he discovered that Howard, knowing too much, had threatened to turn her in to the authorities. A direct threat, a motive. Could she have killed Howard to protect her dark secrets? Unraveling Priscilla's role in this was going to be a daunting task that Winston had to muster the strength to undertake.

You know, cause of bathing and grooming.\\\"\\n\\n\\u201cHmm,...\\\" Winston hummed, rubbing his chin thoughtfully. \\\"You ever work at Howard's place?\\\"\\n\\n\\u201cOf course!\\\" Eric exclaimed quickly. \\\"Known him, his fiancee Gloria, and his pets for a while now. Have them on top of my customer list, along with a large number of other cat and dog owners.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGloria?\\u201d Winston probed.\\n\\nEric's face flushed, \\u201cYes, I've known her for years, almost ten now. I visit her often for work, and...\\u201d\\n\\n\\\"Anything else about Gloria?\\\" Winston interrupted.\\n\\nEric paused for a moment before responding, \\u201cShe\\u2019s special, Gloria. Kind to everything and everyone, she often showed me signs of warmth and kindness.\\\"\\n\\nAs Winston observed Eric, he noticed a notebook lying open on a nearby table. Flipping to the appointments section, he found a number of entries for cat and dog owners, confirming Eric's busy schedule. One page, however, caught his attention: a diary page with 'I love Gloria' written numerous times, speaking volumes about Eric's feelings for her.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you for your time, Eric,\\\" Winston finally said. As he headed towards the door, he turned and asked, \\\"Howard's office, fur on the barbed wire used?\\\"\\n\\nEric nodded. \\\"Yes, found it quite odd. Normally, I only groom pets in their homes.\\\"\\n\\nExiting the home, he made his way back to his car, a new collection of information swirling in his head. Winston had an uneasy feeling about this Eric. He made a mental note to have Eric\\u2019s diary and customer list with a number of cat and dog owners entered into evidence. There were a lot of dots to connect and they seemed to be dancing around in his head.\\n\\nThe blaring sirens came to a halt as Winston arrived at where the latest gruesome killing had taken place. Howard, a man who liked his quiet and often threw himself into work, found dead in his home office. According to initial reports, the murder weapon seemed to be a strand of barbed wire. Winston proceeded towards the crime scene, trying to keep his senses sharp to any clues he might find.\\n\\nPriscilla was a person of interest in the case. Tied to a string of crimes that included the use of barbed wire, she seemed more suspicious with every detail. Winston would be remiss if he didn't get all the facts about her lined up and ready. Priscilla, an ex-military personnel, stood out for her lack of an alibi during the time of murder. Winston made a note to conduct a thorough interrogation.\\n\\nWhile going over the diagrams and photos of the scene, Winston found that Howard's property was surrounded by barbed wire fences. An odd detail to his suburban house. Witnesses - the neighbors- reported seeing Priscilla's car on multiple occasions, and explicitly during the time of the murder, at the fenced property. A regular visitor, it seemed. Priscilla had no alibi, and knew the layout of the house well.\\n\\nHoward, always a reserved man, chose to spend lengthy hours alone in his home office. The numerous sightings of Priscilla at his house during these late work hours, and decisively at the time of murder, intrigued Winston. These were little crumbs, but they pointed Winston in a strong direction.\\n\\nWinston pulled Priscilla in for questioning; she was not an easy nut to crack. She had a history, pervasions into criminal activities that increased her confidence in her ability to avoid capture. Murmurings of previous killings involving barbed wire whirled around her, and each successful kill reportedly fed her sense of power and precision.\\n\\nWinston\\u2019s revelations grew more unnerving when he discovered that Howard, knowing too much, had threatened to turn her in to the authorities. A direct threat, a motive. Could she have killed Howard to protect her dark secrets? Unraveling Priscilla's role in this was going to be a daunting task that Winston had to muster the strength to undertake. Hidden somewhere amidst these scattered pieces of evidence was the truth, waiting to be pieced together.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Eric\\n(b) - Priscilla\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(b) - Priscilla"]], "filtered_resps": ["(b)"], "doc_hash": "c6dd3a68c83c8476ddaa069a8ceae29f8d4de22ce33e9adf0e0948af7d8c1710", "prompt_hash": "f714f2339849b8445b468cb290d5fed32c7f3741da3d3c51f5de1755f0426274", "target_hash": "f89bf797c3b1dda4ee48380783e5e979067686a6a9540c5a40e8d75ae5f3d199", "exact_match": 0.0}

{"doc_id": 110, "doc": {"narrative": "In the winding passages of a labyrinth, Lauren meets her untimely death by nail gun, pulling Detective Winston into a complex maze of lies and danger where Rose and Aubrey become his primary suspects.\n\n\nWinston sat in his dimly lit office, peering over the case details. The name Lauren frequented his mind as he evaluated the circumstances of her death. It was a unique scene to say the least, a murder inside a labyrinth, with a nail gun as the murder weapon of choice.\n\nHis focus then diverted to the name that was on everyone's lips: Rose. She was Lauren's stepsister and her profession stood out to him the most. Rose was a carpenter; she was often required to read blueprints for her job, and had comprehensive knowledge about nail guns due to her regular use of them at work. As it happened, the blueprint of the labyrinth where the body was found was posted at her jobsite. An interesting coincidence, Winston thought, but he knew better than to jump to conclusions.\n\nRose's gang involvement made matters more complicated. As a member of a local gang that took their reputation seriously, she found herself enmeshed in scenarios where respect was the ultimate currency. Winston remembered hearing about a notorious gathering of the gang where Lauren had called Rose a loser. To publicly humiliate her in front of her fellow gang members like that had not been taken lightly. What bothered Winston was that despite Rose being present at a community event nearby, no one noticed her in the labyrinth that day.\n\nConviction settled within Winston. He needed to talk to Rose. Grabbing his coat, he exited the office, his mind reflecting the image of the carpenter, wrapped in the complexities of Lauren's murder. Little did he know, the clues were only beginning to unfold.\n\nDetective Winston put away the photos of the crime scene he was investigating. The labyrinth where Lauren was found, held a certain eerie mystique to it. He began by interviewing the suspect, Aubrey.\n\nWalking into the office of Aubrey was like walking into a different time period. The room was grand and ornate, filled with all types of frames and decor, managed by none other than Aubrey himself, the boss of the esteemed business.\n\nWinston started the conversation careful not to rush. \"You designed the labyrinth?\" he asked, nodding.\n\nA look of pride crossed Aubrey's face, \"Yes, indeed. I even supervised its construction.\"\n\nWinston casually inquired, \"And the labyrinth is part of the business property, I presume?\"\n\n\"Most definitely. It's a showcase, so to speak,\" Aubrey said.\n\nWinston continued the conversation but his attention was drawn by a box in a display case on Aubrey's desk. The box was labeled \"Keepsake\". \"What's in the box?\" he asked.\n\nAubrey looked slightly taken aback before he smiled, \"Oh, that. It's a lock of hair from someone who owed me. This person owed me and this is my keepsake,\" he admitted with an air of nonchalance.\n\nA brief silence followed. Breaking it, Winston continued, \"The labyrinth. Pretty difficult to navigate, I assume. Any blueprints or maps for it?\"\n\nAubrey half shook his head, \"The labyrinth is an enigma, detective, designed to challenge and confound. There are no public maps or blueprints for it.\"\n\nWinston couldn't help but notice a defaced picture in Aubrey's collection. It was a photo of a once close friend, the eyes had been scratched out thoroughly. \"What happened to the picture?\" Winston asked. \n\nAubrey didn't take a second to respond, \"A moment of rage. I was angry at betrayal by an old friend. I scratched the eyes out and after the argument, I put it back in there.\" \n\nLater on, Winston found out about a whispered overheard conversation Aubrey had about Lauren's betrayal as Aubrey was outside Lauren's house. Apparently, Aubrey had overheard a conversation between Lauren and a competitor.

The name Lauren frequented his mind as he evaluated the circumstances of her death. It was a unique scene to say the least, a murder inside a labyrinth, with a nail gun as the murder weapon of choice.\\n\\nHis focus then diverted to the name that was on everyone's lips: Rose. She was Lauren's stepsister and her profession stood out to him the most. Rose was a carpenter; she was often required to read blueprints for her job, and had comprehensive knowledge about nail guns due to her regular use of them at work. As it happened, the blueprint of the labyrinth where the body was found was posted at her jobsite. An interesting coincidence, Winston thought, but he knew better than to jump to conclusions.\\n\\nRose's gang involvement made matters more complicated. As a member of a local gang that took their reputation seriously, she found herself enmeshed in scenarios where respect was the ultimate currency. Winston remembered hearing about a notorious gathering of the gang where Lauren had called Rose a loser. To publicly humiliate her in front of her fellow gang members like that had not been taken lightly. What bothered Winston was that despite Rose being present at a community event nearby, no one noticed her in the labyrinth that day.\\n\\nConviction settled within Winston. He needed to talk to Rose. Grabbing his coat, he exited the office, his mind reflecting the image of the carpenter, wrapped in the complexities of Lauren's murder. Little did he know, the clues were only beginning to unfold.\\n\\nDetective Winston put away the photos of the crime scene he was investigating. The labyrinth where Lauren was found, held a certain eerie mystique to it. He began by interviewing the suspect, Aubrey.\\n\\nWalking into the office of Aubrey was like walking into a different time period. The room was grand and ornate, filled with all types of frames and decor, managed by none other than Aubrey himself, the boss of the esteemed business.\\n\\nWinston started the conversation careful not to rush. \\\"You designed the labyrinth?\\\" he asked, nodding.\\n\\nA look of pride crossed Aubrey's face, \\\"Yes, indeed. I even supervised its construction.\\\"\\n\\nWinston casually inquired, \\\"And the labyrinth is part of the business property, I presume?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Most definitely. It's a showcase, so to speak,\\\" Aubrey said.\\n\\nWinston continued the conversation but his attention was drawn by a box in a display case on Aubrey's desk. The box was labeled \\\"Keepsake\\\". \\\"What's in the box?\\\" he asked.\\n\\nAubrey looked slightly taken aback before he smiled, \\\"Oh, that. It's a lock of hair from someone who owed me. This person owed me and this is my keepsake,\\\" he admitted with an air of nonchalance.\\n\\nA brief silence followed. Breaking it, Winston continued, \\\"The labyrinth. Pretty difficult to navigate, I assume. Any blueprints or maps for it?\\\"\\n\\nAubrey half shook his head, \\\"The labyrinth is an enigma, detective, designed to challenge and confound. There are no public maps or blueprints for it.\\\"\\n\\nWinston couldn't help but notice a defaced picture in Aubrey's collection. It was a photo of a once close friend, the eyes had been scratched out thoroughly. \\\"What happened to the picture?\\\" Winston asked. \\n\\nAubrey didn't take a second to respond, \\\"A moment of rage. I was angry at betrayal by an old friend. I scratched the eyes out and after the argument, I put it back in there.\\\" \\n\\nLater on, Winston found out about a whispered overheard conversation Aubrey had about Lauren's betrayal as Aubrey was outside Lauren's house. Apparently, Aubrey had overheard a conversation between Lauren and a competitor. This lead to the argument and defacement of the photo.\\n\\nAfter the conversation with Aubrey, Winston got a hint towards Aubrey's character.

Aubrey held the keys to these gates with as much reverence as she held the amber locket around her neck.\n\nEven at the dusk, the gates remained locked until every morning, like clockwork, Aubrey would approach. Her eyes filled with a sense of duty, Winston could see the earnest expression on Aubrey's face as she carefully turned keys in the heavy iron lock, thus breaking the morning lock-up routine.\n\nIn the midst of observing this routine, Winston recalled a conversation he had with a museum associate. Aubrey had indeed gone through a weapon-handling workshop for their historical farming tools exhibit. Among the overlapping news and chatter, the museum's collection of farming tools, including old, rusted sickles, had stood out.\n\nThe garden surrounding Aubrey's museum served as a commendable background for her tea dates with Erika. Erika, as a major stakeholder in the museum, had been more than a frequent visitor. That curious connection kept popping up in Winston's head more often than not.\n\nOut of the corner of his eye, Winston observed Aubrey lost in her thoughts. She was walking along the tombstones, meticulously studying and reciting the names engraved upon them. Perhaps it was her way of remembering the past, or maybe just a strange way to unwind.\n\nThere was no one else around, and in the lonesome tranquillity of the graveyard, Aubrey could be seen talking, possibly reciting, to herself. It was a loner's soliloquy, as if she was pouring her secrets over the tombstones just to be buried once again.\n\nWinston could still remember overhearing Aubrey's desperate call for high-interest loans to keep her museum afloat. The economic strain on the museum's budget hadn't escaped Aubrey. His ears rang with her words saying that the repayments on these loans were going to double next month. That, coupled with her responsibility for the acquisition and care of items in the museum's collection, was enough to pressurize any soul.\n\nAs Winston began to tread back towards the unmarked, black investigation car; he noted the quiet cemetery's rusty gates lock again. Every morning, the same routine was played out, the morning locking was now giving way to another day's activities as the wheels started to crunch the gravel beneath, Winston took one last glance towards Aubrey, his suspect and the harbinger of the day's sacred silence.\n\nUnder the intimidating grandeur of the mosque structure, Winston, the detective, sat on a wooden bench, meticulously observing Garry as he was tending the lawn near the west wing. Garry, the only concierge of the mosque, was wiping the brow of his forehead. Beads of sweat flicking off his hand with each move, the masculine, meticulous manner with which he manoeuvered the garden sickle on the greenery, shaped each shrub with an artistic finesse. It was easy to tell he was an old hand with garden tools; his professional grip spoke volumes of his previous life as a farmer. The sickle was a potentially dangerous tool, and Garry's familiarity with it hinted at his past.\n\n\"Hard at work I see,\" Winston observed as he approached the sole handyman. Garry looked up, his eyes narrowing in on the unfamiliar face. \"And who might you be?\" he asked with a hint of caution in his voice. \n\n\"Winston. Detective Winston,\" he introduced himself, tucking the badge away as Garry nodded in understanding. Winston spoke again, \"I believe you were the only staff member on duty during the time of Erika’s murder. I need to chat with you, Garry.\"\n\nErika before, her tragic end, had stumbled upon Garry's criminal records, she expressed her intention to report this to the authorities, making the significance of this conversation unmatched. From the jittery pick-me-up in his darting eyes, it was as though Garry was aware of Erika's intentions and his own past taunting his present.\n\n\"Erika happened to find an unfortunate ending in this room behind me,\" Detective Winston finally broke the silence, pointing in the direction of a closed entrance, \"A room, the keys to which only you have, if I'm not wrong.\" He had leaves no room for doubt about Garry’s exclusive control over those keys.\n\nGarry's attempt to maintain cool was crumbling as the conversation marched ahead straight onto him. \"I just mind my own business, help out the folks around here,\" he defended himself, “The keys to all rooms in the mosque, they are part of my job, not my involvement.”\n\nWinston watched him, not giving away that he knew more than what he was putting into words. As Garry looked away, trying to conceal his anxiety, Winston picked up his hat, excusing himself for the moment. The concierge, the previous criminal, the executor of garden manicuring, the only gatekeeper to Erika’s death room, his presence was crucial to the puzzle surrounding Erika's horrific end. A puzzle that was missing some critical pieces.

Her eyes filled with a sense of duty, Winston could see the earnest expression on Aubrey's face as she carefully turned keys in the heavy iron lock, thus breaking the morning lock-up routine.\\n\\nIn the midst of observing this routine, Winston recalled a conversation he had with a museum associate. Aubrey had indeed gone through a weapon-handling workshop for their historical farming tools exhibit. Among the overlapping news and chatter, the museum's collection of farming tools, including old, rusted sickles, had stood out.\\n\\nThe garden surrounding Aubrey's museum served as a commendable background for her tea dates with Erika. Erika, as a major stakeholder in the museum, had been more than a frequent visitor. That curious connection kept popping up in Winston's head more often than not.\\n\\nOut of the corner of his eye, Winston observed Aubrey lost in her thoughts. She was walking along the tombstones, meticulously studying and reciting the names engraved upon them. Perhaps it was her way of remembering the past, or maybe just a strange way to unwind.\\n\\nThere was no one else around, and in the lonesome tranquillity of the graveyard, Aubrey could be seen talking, possibly reciting, to herself. It was a loner's soliloquy, as if she was pouring her secrets over the tombstones just to be buried once again.\\n\\nWinston could still remember overhearing Aubrey's desperate call for high-interest loans to keep her museum afloat. The economic strain on the museum's budget hadn't escaped Aubrey. His ears rang with her words saying that the repayments on these loans were going to double next month. That, coupled with her responsibility for the acquisition and care of items in the museum's collection, was enough to pressurize any soul.\\n\\nAs Winston began to tread back towards the unmarked, black investigation car; he noted the quiet cemetery's rusty gates lock again. Every morning, the same routine was played out, the morning locking was now giving way to another day's activities as the wheels started to crunch the gravel beneath, Winston took one last glance towards Aubrey, his suspect and the harbinger of the day's sacred silence.\\n\\nUnder the intimidating grandeur of the mosque structure, Winston, the detective, sat on a wooden bench, meticulously observing Garry as he was tending the lawn near the west wing. Garry, the only concierge of the mosque, was wiping the brow of his forehead. Beads of sweat flicking off his hand with each move, the masculine, meticulous manner with which he manoeuvered the garden sickle on the greenery, shaped each shrub with an artistic finesse. It was easy to tell he was an old hand with garden tools; his professional grip spoke volumes of his previous life as a farmer. The sickle was a potentially dangerous tool, and Garry's familiarity with it hinted at his past.\\n\\n\\\"Hard at work I see,\\\" Winston observed as he approached the sole handyman. Garry looked up, his eyes narrowing in on the unfamiliar face. \\\"And who might you be?\\\" he asked with a hint of caution in his voice. \\n\\n\\\"Winston. Detective Winston,\\\" he introduced himself, tucking the badge away as Garry nodded in understanding. Winston spoke again, \\\"I believe you were the only staff member on duty during the time of Erika\\u2019s murder. I need to chat with you, Garry.\\\"\\n\\nErika before, her tragic end, had stumbled upon Garry's criminal records, she expressed her intention to report this to the authorities, making the significance of this conversation unmatched. From the jittery pick-me-up in his darting eyes, it was as though Garry was aware of Erika's intentions and his own past taunting his present.\\n\\n\\\"Erika happened to find an unfortunate ending in this room behind me,\\\" Detective Winston finally broke the silence, pointing in the direction of a closed entrance, \\\"A room, the keys to which only you have, if I'm not wrong.\\\" He had leaves no room for doubt about Garry\\u2019s exclusive control over those keys.\\n\\nGarry's attempt to maintain cool was crumbling as the conversation marched ahead straight onto him. \\\"I just mind my own business, help out the folks around here,\\\" he defended himself, \\u201cThe keys to all rooms in the mosque, they are part of my job, not my involvement.\\u201d\\n\\nWinston watched him, not giving away that he knew more than what he was putting into words. As Garry looked away, trying to conceal his anxiety, Winston picked up his hat, excusing himself for the moment. The concierge, the previous criminal, the executor of garden manicuring, the only gatekeeper to Erika\\u2019s death room, his presence was crucial to the puzzle surrounding Erika's horrific end. A puzzle that was missing some critical pieces.

{"doc_id": 116, "doc": {"narrative": "In the heart of the rainforest, Jesse meets his gruesome end by a lawnmower, leaving Detective Winston embarked on a puzzling quest with suspects - Sam and Steve.\n\nWinston looked over the notes that had been placed on his desk, details about Jesse, a kid he had been killed by a lawnmower in a rainforest during a school trip. Sighing, he prepared himself to go and speak to Sam, a schoolmate of Jesse with a connection to landscaping tools.\n\nArriving at \"Green Leaves Landscaping\", Winston was greeted by the bustling noise of various gardening equipment being operated for demonstrations and repairs. He looked around, noting that this place even had lawnmowers, one in particular stood out.\n\nHe was introduced to Sam. The young man, not much older than Jesse, who seemed jittery and nervous. No doubt upset about his friend's death. \n\n\"Sam, right?\" Winston asked, to which the young man just nodded. \n\n\"Bit of a strange question, but do you know how to operate a lawnmower?\" Winston asked.\n\nA slight nod from Sam confirmed it, \"Yeah, on top of that I passed my course in operating heavy machinery with distinction last summer. I know my way around from lawnmowers to bulldozers.\" \n\nWinston continued with a gentle but probing conversation, leading to Sam mentioning the school field trip to the rainforest that had turned tragic. This sparked another question from Winston. \n\n\"Anyone else in that rainforest, apart from your school group?\" The answer was negative.\n\nThe conversation took a dramatic turn when Sam admitted to finding some inappropriate texts between Jesse and his girlfriend on her phone, showing them to Winston. \n\n\"And she admitted to it?\" Winston pursued, brows furrowed. \"Yes, she confessed when confronted.\" Sam's voice choked up a little.\n\nTaking a mental step back, Winston continued with his questions, \"Your father owns this place?\" \n\nSam's hand gestured around the landscape store run by his father, \"Yeah, been helping him around whenever I'm free.\"\n\nThey chatted for a couple more minutes before Winston thanked Sam for his time and left, informing him that they might need to speak again. He reflected on what he'd learned, about Jesse's cheating, Sam’s landscaping connection and distinction-honored ability to operate heavy machinery. The facts were taking shape in a complex web, beginning to form a picture but with still much to be discovered.\n\nWinston adjusted his fedora and walked into Steve's study in the local synagogue, filled with ancient religious texts, some open and spread out in front of Steve. Steve looked like a man deep in thought, his eyes fixated on the book in front of him. \n\n\"Mind if I interrupt, Rabbi Steve?\" Winston asked, interrupting the tranquility. \n\n\"Detective Winston,\" Steve acknowledged without lifting his eyes. His voice reflected his years, a baritone stained with wisdom. \n\n\"I understand you were meant to be at a number of religious events, which this community is known for, but it appears you were missing in action?\" Winston probed lightly, trying to placate the simmering tension he could already sense. \n\n\"I've been studying, Detective.

Sighing, he prepared himself to go and speak to Sam, a schoolmate of Jesse with a connection to landscaping tools.\\n\\nArriving at \\\"Green Leaves Landscaping\\\", Winston was greeted by the bustling noise of various gardening equipment being operated for demonstrations and repairs. He looked around, noting that this place even had lawnmowers, one in particular stood out.\\n\\nHe was introduced to Sam. The young man, not much older than Jesse, who seemed jittery and nervous. No doubt upset about his friend's death. \\n\\n\\\"Sam, right?\\\" Winston asked, to which the young man just nodded. \\n\\n\\\"Bit of a strange question, but do you know how to operate a lawnmower?\\\" Winston asked.\\n\\nA slight nod from Sam confirmed it, \\\"Yeah, on top of that I passed my course in operating heavy machinery with distinction last summer.

This sparked another question from Winston. \\n\\n\\\"Anyone else in that rainforest, apart from your school group?\\\" The answer was negative.\\n\\nThe conversation took a dramatic turn when Sam admitted to finding some inappropriate texts between Jesse and his girlfriend on her phone, showing them to Winston. \\n\\n\\\"And she admitted to it?\\\" Winston pursued, brows furrowed. \\\"Yes, she confessed when confronted.\\\" Sam's voice choked up a little.\\n\\nTaking a mental step back, Winston continued with his questions, \\\"Your father owns this place?\\\" \\n\\nSam's hand gestured around the landscape store run by his father, \\\"Yeah, been helping him around whenever I'm free.\\\"\\n\\nThey chatted for a couple more minutes before Winston thanked Sam for his time and left, informing him that they might need to speak again. He reflected on what he'd learned, about Jesse's cheating, Sam\\u2019s landscaping connection and distinction-honored ability to operate heavy machinery. The facts were taking shape in a complex web, beginning to form a picture but with still much to be discovered.\\n\\nWinston adjusted his fedora and walked into Steve's study in the local synagogue, filled with ancient religious texts, some open and spread out in front of Steve. Steve looked like a man deep in thought, his eyes fixated on the book in front of him. \\n\\n\\\"Mind if I interrupt, Rabbi Steve?\\\" Winston asked, interrupting the tranquility. \\n\\n\\\"Detective Winston,\\\" Steve acknowledged without lifting his eyes. His voice reflected his years, a baritone stained with wisdom. \\n\\n\\\"I understand you were meant to be at a number of religious events, which this community is known for, but it appears you were missing in action?\\\" Winston probed lightly, trying to placate the simmering tension he could already sense. \\n\\n\\\"I've been studying, Detective.

Eyeing the images, it became immediately apparent among the ropes, carabiners, and pitons that Wade always had one particular piece of gear with him - an axe. Along with the axe, a curious detail drew his attention - a blue bead bracelet that Wade wore on every climb.\n\nAs Winston was engrossed in his photographic search, his assistant entered the room, her eyes teary. \"Detective, I confronted Wade about my bracelet, the one he keeps wearing,\" she said, noticeably upset. \"He brushed me off, claiming that it became a necessary memento from an infamous climbing adventure with him.\" \n\nScratchy phone recorded deductions hung in the air as a woman's voice filled the room, \"Hugo was said to have checked into the campground... the same day as Wade.\"\n\nWinston tapped the ash from his cigarette into an old coffee mug and decided it was time to have a little chat with Mr. Wade. \n\nPulling up to the nearby climbing spot, which was also a well-known campground, he found Wade wiping the sweat off his brow as he examined a climbing route, axe handle sticking out from his backpack. The seasoned detective noted that they were at the plot adjacent to where Hugo had camped.\n\nWade looked up, seeing Winston step out of his car. \"Hey, detective... what brings you out here?\"\n\nWinston crossed his arms, gaze lingering on the axe handle. \"Thought it was time we had a chat.\"\n\nWade chuckled, adjusting the strap of the blue bead bracelet that was hanging loosely on his wrist, \"Alright then, shoot.\"\n\nWinston observed the bracelet, recognizing it from the pictures. Wade had worn the same bracelet during many of his climbs since their unfortunate expedition, even calling it his “lucky charm.” So much so, that it garnered attention on social media.\n\n\"My understanding is you venture here quite often for your climbing escapades,\" Winston inquired.\n\n\"That's right,\" Wade answered casually, seemingly unaware of the implications of Winston’s words.\n\n\"And these climbs you embark on... they always need an axe, I presume?\" Winston pointed at the tool that held such relevance.\n\n“Depends on the route, detective. Good to have it with me though,” Wade replied, clearly more interested in his climbing equipment than the conversation.\n\nNoting the piece of jewelry, Winston decided the conversation had run its course. \"You were camping here the same day as Hugo, weren’t you?\"\n\n“Yeah,” Wade replied, losing his grin, “I believe so. We were actually just a few plots apart. Didn’t know him well though.”\n\n“Hmm, alright…” Winston muttered, tipping his hat in goodbye as he got back into his car. His assistant’s bracelet glinted in the sunlight as Wade prepared for his climb. One step in the investigation was over, but many were still left to climb.\n\nWinston was sitting alone in his office, pouring over the sparse details he had on Hugo's murder. The crime scene, a picturesque campground, had been a haven for families just hours before. Winston rubbed his temples, knowing full well that these types of cases took delicate maneuvering, careful data collection. His lead suspect, a man named Salvador, was Hugo's driving instructor. This connection alone might not mean much, but it was a start. \n\nWinston took a deep breath, called up the local police and made an appointment to subtly interview Salvador. \n\nWinston found him at the driving school, hands deftly managing a hairpin turn while teaching a student. After the driving lesson ended, Winston introduced himself. \n\n\"Salvador?\" \n\n\"Yeah, that's me,\" he replied, wiping sweat from his brow.\n\nWinston motioned to a nearby bench. \"Do you mind if we chat for a few moments?\"\n\nSalvador glanced at his watch. \"Sure, I've got a few minutes.\"\n\nThey sat. \n\n\"Nice day out, isn't it?\" Canvasing the area, Winston's eyes landed on a small poster. The image was of a verdant campground, similar to the one where Hugo was killed. \"You like camping, Salvador?\"\n\nSalvador, caught off guard, blinked. \"Yes, I do. I go regularly, whenever I can... even to that campground over there\". \n\nThey chatted about the great outdoors, the joy of being connected with nature, and the complexities of their camping hobbies. Salvador didn’t seem aware that Winston’s questions were leading to anything in particular.\n\nAfter a few minutes of casual conversation, Winston stood up from the bench. \"Thanks for talking with me, Salvador. Nice day, isn't it?\" \n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" Salvador replied, stretching his arms. He watched Winston drove away curiously, before shaking his head and walking back to his car.\n\nWinston's next stop was Salvador's house; he observed from a safe distance as Salvador fiddled with something in his garage. Later, when Salvador had retreated into his house, Winston took a closer look under the cover of darkness. He could see an array of axes, various sizes and shapes, displayed proudly on a wall. He saw newly chopped wood stacked neatly in the corner of his backyard, evidence of Salvador’s recent chopping endeavours.\n\nWinston shared his observations with the local police but stepped back after providing his input.

It was clear that Salvador knew how to handle an axe, and there was one found at his place that matched the murder weapon.\n\nWinston knew convictions weren't made on this sort of circumstantial evidence, but there were threads that linked Salvador to the crime scene.

The case puzzled him; a man named Clyde was found dead at his chalet, poisoned by snake venom.\n\nWinston sipped his coffee, his thoughts turning to the list of witnesses. The intriguing one was Clyde’s adoptive mother, Taylor. Records indicated she owned a cleaning business, which surprisingly, did not require her or anyone else for that matter, to use different names for business operations. Interesting, Winston thought.\n\nThe cleaning business, however, brought Taylor in frequent contact with venomous snakes due to the locations she was often required to clean. In addition to this, upon further investigation into her past, Winston discovered she had once taken a course on reptile handling and first aid, where she had learned how to administer snake venom. This piqued Winston’s curiosity about Taylor's hobby - her interest in studying and handling snakes. \n\nWinston then took a drive across town to the café where Taylor often frequented. The barista, a young chipper man, recognized Taylor’s name instantly. \n\n“Yeah, big tipper. Always uses a new name when she orders though. Can’t keep up,” he admitted, making an apologetic face.\n\n“Does she always order to-go?” Winston asked. \n\n“Yeah, never stays long.\"\n\nAs he left the café for a public park, Winston could not help but think how it was not just cafes she used different names in. One of the regular park goers also confirmed witnessing Taylor introduce herself with a different name every time she would meet someone new. There was no law requiring her not to, but it was unusual. \n\nTo get a bit more insight, Winston then took a detour and checked her medical records at the local clinic. The records showed frequent admissions for different sort of injuries, seeming to be consistent with those of an abuse victim.\n\nThe final piece in this part of the puzzle was Clyde’s history of domestic violence. Clyde’s neighbours recalled his frequent violent outbursts and admitted that they had worried for Taylor's safety. \n\nOne neighbour, an elderly woman by the name of Gertrude, stated, \"That poor Taylor...she always seemed scared of him.

His hobby including keeping up to date on the latest snake discoveries was all over the article. An enigma wrapped in exotic scales.\n\nWinston set off to pay Mack a visit at his quite aptly titled store, 'The Design Dwelling.' As he entered, Winston's eyes glimpsed over recent store receipts strewn on the countertop — snake food, terrarium equipment, and the marked receipt for the venomous snake purchase formed a large chunk of the billings. His gaze then shifted to the restless store-owner. \n\n\"Mack?\" Winston extended a handshake in greeting. \n\n\"Yes, that's me,\" Mack offered a firm grip and an uncertain smile.\n\n\"I see you've got a fascination with the scaled creatures,\" Winston gestured towards the receipts. \n\n\"Just a hobby of mine, detective.

Mack, the man responsible for the rich interior designs was engrossed in sketching a new collection, his exotic reptile sculptures reflecting his extensive knowledge of reptile anatomy and he was known for keeping up with the latest snake discoveries as part of his hobby. \n\n“You Mack?” Winston asked, catching the man's attention. Mack turned to face the detective, revealing a chiseled face accentuated with some disturbing scars. \n\n\"Mack's who you're chattin' to now.\" His tone was casual but assertive. His posture was confident, but his eyes, they held a disconcerting intensity, like a reptile about to strike. \n\nWinston was about to ask about the intriguing designs, instead, Mack strode across the room to a glass terrarium. He sifted his way through a mess of receipts on the barren desk to pull out a small, clear plastic box. \n\n\"I've a hobby that keeps me distracted from work sometimes. Reptiles... snakes, to be precise. A passion I picked up in college,\" he said. He chuckled a little as he offered some snake food to the terrifying critter, its vibrant colors making one's blood run cold.\n\nOn noticing the detective's curiosity regarding the terrarium and the snake held within, Mack revealed, \"Ah, she's a recent purchase. A gorgeous specimen of venomous elegance,\" a peculiar gleam in Mack's eyes as he stared back at the snake, locked in an uncanny understanding.\n\nWinston's gaze wandered to the vast array of receipts adorning the studio desk, most of them marked for snake food and terrarium equipment. But nothing here attached the man to the scars on his face. Curiosity piqued he attempted to steer the conversation towards the scars.\n\nHowever, Mack's expression immediately hardened, curtly shifting the conversation to something less personal, \"That's not your concern, detective.\" It was evident then; Mack wasn’t one to let others take control of the conversation. \n\nAs the detective prepared to leave, Mack added, “I don't get out much. A lot of work crammed here, keeps me pinned down.\" His eyes darted towards a letter, one discovered amongst a pile of threatening letters. All unmistakably written in Clyde’s handwriting rightly threatening Mack’s sister. \n\n\"Ever deal with Clyde?\" Winston inquired. \"I confronted him about his threats to my sister, and that's when Clyde audaciously admitted to them,\" Mack bravely confessed. He further added that he reported the assault immediately after it happened, one he unfortunately happened to witness.\n\nSuitably intrigued, Winston respectfully excused himself with the promise of returning. He found Mack to be a complex subject, snakes, design, and all. The circumstances around Mack and his relation to Clyde evidently needed a more in-depth look.\n\nWinston rubbed his aching temples as he scrutinized the information sprawled across his desk. It had been a long day, and the recent news of Clyde's death hadn't provided any form of convenience.\n\nHe fixated his attention on his prime suspect, Taylor, the adoptive mother of the victim. Her profession as a snake specialist had always struck him as odd, especially now, in a case involving snake venom. Winston slid the calendar invite across the table. “So, you had a day scheduled with Clyde at his chalet, the day of his... incident? A whole day alone with him according to this...”\n\nTaylor nodded softly, her voice was barely above a whisper. \"Just chance... We always planned mother-son days. He loved that chalet. We spent long periods alone there, just us. But things were different that day... I was... scared.\"\n\n\"In public, Clyde wasn't any easier either. There were numerous events where he would explode in anger, catching the sight of all those around him,\" Winston said, recalling the instances of Clyde's violent outbursts that he had documented from his surveys.\n\nIn the hours Winston spent with Taylor, he noted how she seemed on edge. Her eyes darted around the room, clothing neatly arranged, concealing what he suspected might be the aftermath of several violent confrontations. His suspicion was soon confirmed when he found a stack of hospital records tucked away at Taylor’s home detailing her prior injury treatments.\n\n\"Clyde... He got angry often, and I was always the target,\" Taylor admitted when Winston confronted her with the records. \"He sometimes had violent outbursts in public too, but he was my son. I stayed. I always tried to stay safe. Most of my work is behind the glass. You know, handling snakes only under controlled circumstances. Some are venomous, yes.\"\n\n\"Was Clyde aware of the risks in dealing with venomous snakes?\" Winston pressed on, folding his hands atop the table, leaning in, looking for answers within Taylor's eyes. \n\n\"Of course,\" Taylor replied. \"I've had to explain to him before... How the venom works. Why it's dangerous. Even how it's administered if mishandled... But the fear... Clyde was terrifying.\"\n\nThrough her narrative, Winston realized how comfortable she was around venomous snakes, a fact that only heightened his suspicion. He always found such risky professions unnerving.  \n\nFurther interviews with Clyde's friends confirmed Taylor's account of his violent tendencies. In fact, Clyde had confided his plans of spending the day with his mother at the chalet only to these friends. Other than Taylor, nobody else was seen at the chalet during the time of the incident. \n\nInspecting all the data, Winston realized he'd woven together a vast yet mystifying narrative. He reassured Taylor one final time before exiting. \"Thank you Taylor, I will be in touch.\"\n\nAs he left Taylor's abode, he took one last glance at her.

All unmistakably written in Clyde\\u2019s handwriting rightly threatening Mack\\u2019s sister. \\n\\n\\\"Ever deal with Clyde?\\\" Winston inquired. \\\"I confronted him about his threats to my sister, and that's when Clyde audaciously admitted to them,\\\" Mack bravely confessed. He further added that he reported the assault immediately after it happened, one he unfortunately happened to witness.\\n\\nSuitably intrigued, Winston respectfully excused himself with the promise of returning. He found Mack to be a complex subject, snakes, design, and all. The circumstances around Mack and his relation to Clyde evidently needed a more in-depth look.\\n\\nWinston rubbed his aching temples as he scrutinized the information sprawled across his desk. It had been a long day, and the recent news of Clyde's death hadn't provided any form of convenience.\\n\\nHe fixated his attention on his prime suspect, Taylor, the adoptive mother of the victim. Her profession as a snake specialist had always struck him as odd, especially now, in a case involving snake venom. Winston slid the calendar invite across the table. \\u201cSo, you had a day scheduled with Clyde at his chalet, the day of his... incident? A whole day alone with him according to this...\\u201d\\n\\nTaylor nodded softly, her voice was barely above a whisper. \\\"Just chance... We always planned mother-son days. He loved that chalet. We spent long periods alone there, just us. But things were different that day... I was... scared.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In public, Clyde wasn't any easier either. There were numerous events where he would explode in anger, catching the sight of all those around him,\\\" Winston said, recalling the instances of Clyde's violent outbursts that he had documented from his surveys.\\n\\nIn the hours Winston spent with Taylor, he noted how she seemed on edge. Her eyes darted around the room, clothing neatly arranged, concealing what he suspected might be the aftermath of several violent confrontations. His suspicion was soon confirmed when he found a stack of hospital records tucked away at Taylor\\u2019s home detailing her prior injury treatments.\\n\\n\\\"Clyde... He got angry often, and I was always the target,\\\" Taylor admitted when Winston confronted her with the records. \\\"He sometimes had violent outbursts in public too, but he was my son. I stayed. I always tried to stay safe. Most of my work is behind the glass. You know, handling snakes only under controlled circumstances. Some are venomous, yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Was Clyde aware of the risks in dealing with venomous snakes?\\\" Winston pressed on, folding his hands atop the table, leaning in, looking for answers within Taylor's eyes. \\n\\n\\\"Of course,\\\" Taylor replied. \\\"I've had to explain to him before... How the venom works. Why it's dangerous. Even how it's administered if mishandled... But the fear... Clyde was terrifying.\\\"\\n\\nThrough her narrative, Winston realized how comfortable she was around venomous snakes, a fact that only heightened his suspicion. He always found such risky professions unnerving.  \\n\\nFurther interviews with Clyde's friends confirmed Taylor's account of his violent tendencies. In fact, Clyde had confided his plans of spending the day with his mother at the chalet only to these friends. Other than Taylor, nobody else was seen at the chalet during the time of the incident. \\n\\nInspecting all the data, Winston realized he'd woven together a vast yet mystifying narrative. He reassured Taylor one final time before exiting. \\\"Thank you Taylor, I will be in touch.\\\"\\n\\nAs he left Taylor's abode, he took one last glance at her. He noticed the fear in her eyes, and he knew, her trauma was far from over.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Mack\\n(b) - Taylor\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(b) - Taylor"]], "filtered_resps": ["(b)"], "doc_hash": "fe1b7d924f0a4675515139baabcfc70b21a50a1596736e0899c3689335d754e4", "prompt_hash": "6ce30893042b66739faaa557a49ae4371755091fac504f591b9b23e7418d10b3", "target_hash": "f89bf797c3b1dda4ee48380783e5e979067686a6a9540c5a40e8d75ae5f3d199", "exact_match": 0.0}

It was not just her source of income; it was her status, her life. The allegation that she had been plagiarizing her choreographies... it was a heavy burden. Justin’s impending confession would have been devastating. Yvette had seen an early draft of the revealing speech herself.\n\n\"Did the speech upset you, Yvette?\" He asked, wrapping up his interrogation. \n\n\"What can I say detective, people have opinions,\" Yvette defended, \"I just try to focus on my work.\"\n\nEngagements done for the day, detective Winston made his way back to the precinct.

He dug out the files about Lillian's background. Lillian had frequently disclosed amongst her circle of friends that she passionately coveted the captain's position.\n\n\"Does the therapy center monitor use of rope?\" Winston enquired casually.\n\n\"No sir, we don't have any set rules about rope usage here,\" Nurse Emma replied, \"Otherwise we'd not be able to perform a lot of exercises.\"\n\nNurse Emma appeared aloof, \"Trust me, I've tried to make a conversation with her.

Justin had been such a force in his team, respected, a captain among men, though some might say too powerful. Now his power was reduced to the echo of ice skates and a somber memorial created by a grieving fan base. Justin had been planning to retire soon. The season had been hard on the team, one loss after another piling on each other, and perhaps that weighted on Justin’s mind. He spent a lot of time at this rink, long hours practicing, lamenting, dwelling.\n\nAs cold as the rink was, Winston had another colder, less inviting place to visit - Lillian, a self-proclaimed follower of hockey and a big fan of Justin's team. She'd made her way to the rink too and spent a notable amount of time on the ice when the security cameras had proven to be faulty, no eyes spying her presence. The timing of her visits struck Winston as interesting. \n\nWinston arrived at the therapy center where Lillian was a patient. All around her, she saw various intriguing treatments - the use of ropes for exercise prominently in use. They seemed innocuous, everyday objects one wouldn’t look twice at in this setting, yet she had to remember that one such rope was the murder weapon. The center’s policies were loose, not closely monitoring rope use or restricting patients from borrowing it.\n\nShe found Lillian in one of the therapy rooms, working through her regimen, her face a mask of exerted effort as she battled her way through a routine with the ropes.\n\n“How are your sessions coming along, Lillian?” Winston asked. \n\nLillian paused, sweat glistening off her forehead. “It’s been therapeutic, they are helping me,\" she replied.\n\nWinston watched as Lillian resumed her therapy. She mused over a nugget of a conversation Lillian had with a friend she'd come across in her investigation. \"I would make a better captain than Justin,\" Lillian had bemoaned.\n\nWinston looked at Lillian, her determination in handling the ropes, her eyes set out on a possible future where she could fill Justin’s skates, and couldn’t help but think of how Justin’s power had irked Lillian.\n\nWinston walked away from the center, leaving Lillian to her thoughts and her rope therapy. But as she got in her car, she couldn't shake off the eerie feeling of rustling ropes echoing in the cold air of the rink and the fierce determination in Lillian’s eyes.\n\nInstinctively, Winston flipped open his notepad as he arrived at the local hockey rink.

Eugene had been a regular player at the local laser tag arena and had just recently spoken publicly about an upcoming event. Tragically, the last event proved fatal for him.\n\nWinston moved his attention from the depressing case files to a stack of books lent to him by the local library. All were martial arts manuals. He grabbed one at random and idly flipped through it. Being a tenured police officer, he could tell those books had been heavily used. The slight creases on the spine, the wear on the edges of the book indicated to someone's use. And that someone happened to be his prime suspect: Timothy, the novelist.\n\nTimothy was known for his meticulous crafting of characters, mimicking their behaviors and mannerisms. He was currently working on a secretive character. People often tried to ask about Timothy's childhood to understand better where he derived his characters. However, he generally kept his past to himself.

After checking it, he made a face and sighed. He put it aside, glancing at Winston. \"Let's not dwell on the past, shall we?\"\n\nSurprised by Timothy’s response, which he typically gave when people asked about his childhood, Wiston decided to redirect the conversation.\n\nTimothy then pointed to a stack of documents on the coffee table, \"I signed up for the laser tag event.

Santiago's deep love for his expansive land wouldn't allow it to change hands. His particular appreciation for nature was unmatched, even a confirmed legend of hidden treasure located somewhere in its vast landscapes did not sway him to sell. That hidden treasure surely was captivating, but it didn't stop others from having an interest in the land though...\n\nOne name kept appearing on Winston’s radar - Orville. An orthodontist by trade, he had a strangely intense interest in Santiago’s mountain territory with its hidden treasure. His colleagues at the office had even noticed some tools missing after he'd left for the weekend.\n\nHanging on the wall of his clinic were several pistols on display, including one that remarkably resembled the murder weapon.

Moreover, he’d been observed planning a camping trip over the weekend, although he always answered in vagaries about the nature of his trips when questioned by coworkers.\n\nA chime from his laptop interrupted Winston's thoughts.

Orville... he had planned a camping trip this weekend. We tried asking him about it, but he... he just wouldn't respond.\"\n\nWinston thanked her and dropped the call.

From what he gathered from his notes, Troy wasn't just any astrophysicist. He was a man shaped by discipline and challenge, forged in the unforgiving inferno of military service where he honed his firearm expertise. His precision wasn’t confined to science alone. He frequently reminisced about his days at service.\n\nArriving at Troy's house in the city, he found the astrophysicist on his porch, quietly nursing a bottle of beer, eyes fixed on the sky. \"You have a familiarity with guns, from your service days, right Troy?” Winston asked.\n\nTroy glanced toward Winston, a strange melancholy in his eyes. \"Firearm expertise was a specialty of mine once. It’s not something you forget... And let's not forget the ammunition needed which is also as important as the gun itself,\" His words hung heavily in the quiet night air.\n\nWinston gave a nod of understanding, shifting the conversation. “There was quite a kerfuffle over the award this year.

He uses my research, puts his name on my work, conveniently wins and even had the audacity to choose someone else over me.\" Troy’s voice held an all too familiar bitterness.\n\nWinston filed the comment away mentally, moving on to the gun purchase caught on the store’s surveillance. “Someone told me they saw you in the gun shop recently. Buying a new piece and loading on ammunition?”\n\nTroy locked eyes with Winston, neither flinching nor stammering as he confirmed, \"Yeah. I bought a pistol and got ammunition too. Nothing wrong in owning a gun and enough shells, especially when you know your way around them.\"\n\nSantiago's murder, Troy’s frustration and the gun purchase were all there. Winston allowed himself that familiar pinch of doubt as he left Troy's house. But he also knew that the isolated cabin’s single point of access has been under camera surveillance that fateful night. Its cold, unblinking eye caught every movement, every shadow. It offered no escape.\n\nThe timestamp on the camera feed matched the coroner's estimated time of death, leaving no room for error.

Camille, Floyd's daughter, seemed like the kind of young rich heiress that didn't need much but still desired more.

{"doc_id": 132, "doc": {"narrative": "In the heart of a verdant rainforest, Isla had tragically met her end by a lead pipe, prompting Detective Winston to start sifting through the eerie silence, with Jesse and Brian as the prime suspects.\n\nWinston frowned in concentration while browsing through the piles of family photos placed tastefully on a side table at the ceremony.  Isla, the beautiful young woman, was the star in almost every picture. Winston scanned every photo meticulously, but Brian, who had been a janitor for the family for many years, was nowhere to be found.\n\nHis attention was diverted from the photographs when the back door of the mortuary creaked open, and Brian stepped in hesitantly. He seemed self-conscious about his tardiness, his back hunched and his gaze darting around the room. Winston glanced over at the service in progress. Brian wasn’t mentioned as a friend or a relative during the service, but he stayed until the end of the burial, lingering as the crowd started to disperse. His aloof demeanor piqued Winston’s interest.\n\nThe next day found Winston scanning the tools in Brian's workspace. As per his janitorial duties, Brian handled an assortment of tools, the most common of which were lead pipes. His workspace deep in the jungle revealed that he had been working there for many years, in fact, over a decade, blending his job with nature, dirt, and rust.\n\nWinston remembered that a witness had seen Brian cleaning in the rainforest, a lead pipe in hand, on the same day Isla’s body was discovered. Brian was probably mending a burst pipe he had mentioned to Winston during a casual conversation. The rainforest, where Isla had been brutally murdered, was - oddly enough - a second home to Brian. Rainforest cleaning sounded strange to Winston but perhaps that was the way of life here.\n\nThe rainforest echoed with the sounds of both man-made and natural life around him. Winston watched the intricate work Brian was involved in. As the detective, he mused, \"So, I hear you've been here a while,\" while eyeing Brian maneuver a lead pipe he was using to fix a water valve.\n\n\"Yep, over a decade now,\" was Brian's gruff reply, his hands occupied. He paused to wipe his brow with a grimy arm. \"It's quite peaceful here, you know.\"\n\nWinston's gaze lingered on Brian before he divulged, \"You were spotted here around the same time Isla was murdered.\" Their eyes met for a moment before Winston disappeared back into the foliage.\n\nDetective Winston leaned against his cruiser, his eyes tracking the locals as they went about their daily lives. Faces lit up and heads turned as the rhythmic sound of drumming floated through the air. The source of this daily ritual was Jesse, a powerhouse drummer whose status in the town was akin to that of a local hero—a status enjoyed due to his immense talent on the drums.\n\nWinston watched Jesse for a moment longer, taking in the muscles that rippled in his arms as he played. His talent was undeniable, his every beat pounding out a rhythm that seemed to embody the heart of the community itself. He had spent countless hours practicing, strengthening his upper body and arms through his ceaseless devotion to drumming.\n\nBreaking away from the crowd, Winston took the path that led through the rainforest. Evidence suggested that Jesse visited this place often—where he drew inspiration from the symphony of nature itself and penned down melodies. It was known that his best works as a drummer were composed here. Wandering deeper into the rainforest, Winston couldn't help but try to see this place as Jesse might.\n\nA few days ago, Jesse had overheard Isla's nervous whispers about her intent to confess something incriminating to the police, something concerning Jesse himself. The knowledge threw him into a state of unease. Fearing what Isla might reveal about his involvement in illegal activities—activities she had discovered herself—had let the rhythm of Jesse's drumming take a harsher beat. \n\nAn association with a metalworking shop came up during the preliminary investigation.  This was the place where Jesse had learned to customize his drumsticks himself, favoring lead piping instead of the usual. It was a small token of uniqueness he added to his music but somehow felt out of sync with the rest.\n\nReturning to his cruiser, Winston pulled out a notepad, flipping to a blank page. Isla's name was written at the top, her connection to Jesse much more than casual. In her possession were the evidence of Jesse's illegal activities capable of damaging, if not entirely ruining Jesse's career and standing in the community.\n\nThe pounding of the drums echoed through the stillness of the rainforest, lending an ominous tone to the otherwise peaceful atmosphere. Jesse was aware of his imminent predicament—an inevitable reckoning with his secrets, aided by Isla's confessions.\n\nAnother day in the town ended, and with it, Jesse's drumming ceased. But for him, his day was far from over. His routine entailed hours of practice and composing, maintaining his superiority in the art. Jesse's skill was a result of his consistent hard work and dedication, his muscular prowess a testament to both.\n\nFor Detective Winston, Jesse was a suspect, committing a crime possibly to protect a secret shrouded by the rhythm of his drums.

Isla, the beautiful young woman, was the star in almost every picture. Winston scanned every photo meticulously, but Brian, who had been a janitor for the family for many years, was nowhere to be found.\\n\\nHis attention was diverted from the photographs when the back door of the mortuary creaked open, and Brian stepped in hesitantly. He seemed self-conscious about his tardiness, his back hunched and his gaze darting around the room. Winston glanced over at the service in progress. Brian wasn\\u2019t mentioned as a friend or a relative during the service, but he stayed until the end of the burial, lingering as the crowd started to disperse. His aloof demeanor piqued Winston\\u2019s interest.\\n\\nThe next day found Winston scanning the tools in Brian's workspace. As per his janitorial duties, Brian handled an assortment of tools, the most common of which were lead pipes. His workspace deep in the jungle revealed that he had been working there for many years, in fact, over a decade, blending his job with nature, dirt, and rust.\\n\\nWinston remembered that a witness had seen Brian cleaning in the rainforest, a lead pipe in hand, on the same day Isla\\u2019s body was discovered. Brian was probably mending a burst pipe he had mentioned to Winston during a casual conversation. The rainforest, where Isla had been brutally murdered, was - oddly enough - a second home to Brian. Rainforest cleaning sounded strange to Winston but perhaps that was the way of life here.\\n\\nThe rainforest echoed with the sounds of both man-made and natural life around him. Winston watched the intricate work Brian was involved in. As the detective, he mused, \\\"So, I hear you've been here a while,\\\" while eyeing Brian maneuver a lead pipe he was using to fix a water valve.\\n\\n\\\"Yep, over a decade now,\\\" was Brian's gruff reply, his hands occupied. He paused to wipe his brow with a grimy arm. \\\"It's quite peaceful here, you know.\\\"\\n\\nWinston's gaze lingered on Brian before he divulged, \\\"You were spotted here around the same time Isla was murdered.\\\" Their eyes met for a moment before Winston disappeared back into the foliage.\\n\\nDetective Winston leaned against his cruiser, his eyes tracking the locals as they went about their daily lives. Faces lit up and heads turned as the rhythmic sound of drumming floated through the air. The source of this daily ritual was Jesse, a powerhouse drummer whose status in the town was akin to that of a local hero\\u2014a status enjoyed due to his immense talent on the drums.\\n\\nWinston watched Jesse for a moment longer, taking in the muscles that rippled in his arms as he played. His talent was undeniable, his every beat pounding out a rhythm that seemed to embody the heart of the community itself. He had spent countless hours practicing, strengthening his upper body and arms through his ceaseless devotion to drumming.\\n\\nBreaking away from the crowd, Winston took the path that led through the rainforest. Evidence suggested that Jesse visited this place often\\u2014where he drew inspiration from the symphony of nature itself and penned down melodies. It was known that his best works as a drummer were composed here. Wandering deeper into the rainforest, Winston couldn't help but try to see this place as Jesse might.\\n\\nA few days ago, Jesse had overheard Isla's nervous whispers about her intent to confess something incriminating to the police, something concerning Jesse himself. The knowledge threw him into a state of unease. Fearing what Isla might reveal about his involvement in illegal activities\\u2014activities she had discovered herself\\u2014had let the rhythm of Jesse's drumming take a harsher beat. \\n\\nAn association with a metalworking shop came up during the preliminary investigation.  This was the place where Jesse had learned to customize his drumsticks himself, favoring lead piping instead of the usual. It was a small token of uniqueness he added to his music but somehow felt out of sync with the rest.\\n\\nReturning to his cruiser, Winston pulled out a notepad, flipping to a blank page. Isla's name was written at the top, her connection to Jesse much more than casual. In her possession were the evidence of Jesse's illegal activities capable of damaging, if not entirely ruining Jesse's career and standing in the community.\\n\\nThe pounding of the drums echoed through the stillness of the rainforest, lending an ominous tone to the otherwise peaceful atmosphere. Jesse was aware of his imminent predicament\\u2014an inevitable reckoning with his secrets, aided by Isla's confessions.\\n\\nAnother day in the town ended, and with it, Jesse's drumming ceased. But for him, his day was far from over. His routine entailed hours of practice and composing, maintaining his superiority in the art. Jesse's skill was a result of his consistent hard work and dedication, his muscular prowess a testament to both.\\n\\nFor Detective Winston, Jesse was a suspect, committing a crime possibly to protect a secret shrouded by the rhythm of his drums. As he drove away, the murmuring of the locals filled his ears, talking excitedly about Jesse's session for the day. A crime in the community, a rhythm disrupted.

It was his day off, a rare occasion in the life of a hardened detective, but duty didn't respect quiet mornings or coffee. The unfortunate murder of Isla had occurred on his watch and it was up to him to untangle the clues left behind.\n\nHe found himself standing in a vast rainforest. The very place where Isla met her untimely demise. His experienced eyes scanned the area before landing on a familiar figure. It was Brian, the janitor, seen at all hours, obsessively stalking Isla. It was just his luck that he was wiping away the forest's mess on the same day Isla was murdered.\n\n\"Brian,\" Winston nodded in his approach.\n\n\"Detective,\" Brian glanced over, he had the sort of look about him that suggested countless solitary hours, only interrupted by the hustle of cleaning. \n\n\"I've been hearing you're no stranger to dealing with broken things.\" Winston observed Brian's hands that were well-versed in handling tools: hammers, wrenches, even lead pipes. His workspace, a vast and meticulous orchestration of order amidst chaos, was proof of that.\n\n\"Mmm, yeah.\" Brian's face softened. A chase of a memory flickered over his face of all the times he had publicly declared his deep love for Isla. \"Isla was one of those broken things. I thought I could fix her. My love her was no secret. I couldn’t live without her,” he confessed his frequent late night contemplations. \n\nDespite the heaviness of the conversation, Winston resumed his careful perusal of Brian’s workspace. His attention was drawn to eerily similar lead pipes, ones that resembled the murder weapon the most. They were common in Brian's line of work, not only for the miscellaneous repairs but also to manage some uncontrollable burst pipes.\n\n\"Managed to fix a burst pipe, haven't you Brian?\" Winston queried, but pondered, could that skill have escalated to the darker realms?\n\n\"Many of them, to be exact. That one over yonder nearly ruined my workspace.\" Brian chuckled, pointing at a spot behind Winston.\n\n\"And yet you're here, hours after word gets out about Isla…”\n\n“It’s been a decade, detective. A decade plus of working in this rainforest and Isla was…” Brian's voice hitched a moment, \"...she was everything. I couldn't live without her.\"\n\nJust then, a soft rustling filled the silence. To Winston's surprise, the lights of Brian's obsession with Isla emerged. He intuitively directed Winston five steps to the left. A moment later, a large tree branch came crashing down exactly where Winston had stood, a product of the lush, unpredictable rainforest Brian had been maintaining for over a decade.\n\n\"Thanks. I suppose you know this place, like back of your hand, huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Comes with the territory.\"\n\nWinston repeated his mantra mentally. Every suspect is just a character until proven guilty. As he wound his way back, the very last thing his purposeful steps echoed in Brian's lonely world was when Isla’s public rejection had embarrassingly stung Brian.\n\nBut facts were facts. A man, admittedly obsessed with a woman, now found murdered in a place he had called home for a decade, at a time he definitely was present. A man who liked to fix things, had access to tools, especially lead pipes. All facts, all cataloged. But Winston was far from writing the end to this chapter.

He was no ordinary member of the club, he was the president and also a famed drummer. His rhythmic skills had not only provided him with a lifestyle most would envy but also a sizable disposable income, leading to his immense respect and love from his community. Jesse was known for having a lot of free time, especially on the weekends. Jesse became Winston's next stop in the investigation.\n\nIgnoring the pulsating heat of the afternoon, Winston headed to Jesse's house. Guided by the rhythmic sounds of a drum that echoed in the stillness, he made his way. As he neared, the drumming ceased and Jesse's piercing gaze met him.\n\n\"Detective Winston,\" Jesse rose to his feet, \"I've been expecting you.\"\n\n\"Expecting me?\" Winston asked, a raised eyebrow almost disappearing under his cap.\n\n\"Yes, I heard about poor Isla,\" Jesse replied, a flicker of sadness crossed his face.\n\nJesse was a frequent visitor of the rainforest during his free weekends, a place he went seeking inspiration for his musical compositions. \"Rainforest vibes, man, they produce the best drum solos,\" he said, crediting his most impressive works as a drummer to the time he spent in the rainforest, jotting down notes in his notepad.\n\nSuddenly, his phone rang and he seemingly needed privacy for the call, returning after a few minutes looking flustered. Winston noted this change but didn't comment.\n\nJesse began to discuss the club. He described it as a casual group that met every fortnight to discuss famous unsolved crime mysteries, watch documentaries, and talk about criminal profiling. \"The irony,\" he laughed dryly, \"now we have our own club mystery.\"\n\nTalking about Isla seemed to disturb him. He confessed, \"I overheard Isla a few days ago... she found out about my… my involvement in illegal activities.

{"doc_id": 135, "doc": {"narrative": "In the dense, dank heart of the rainforest, Skylar's life was brutally silenced with a lead pipe, leaving Detective Winston to navigate a labyrinth of lies, offered up by the two prime suspects - Albert and Mya.\n\nDetective Winston put down Skylar's phone, there was a series of text messages that stood out to him involving an invitation to a camping trip. He sat back and scratched his chin thoughtfully as it fell into place with the CCTV footage - Skylar and Mya entering the rainforest alone.\n\nMaking a note of this, he remembered another piece of CCTV footage from two days back, showing Mya packing for what seems to be a camping trip. The footage included one notable item within her gear – a lead pipe, distinct because Mya seemed to pay particular attention to it.\n\nHe decided to pay a visit to Mya. She was found at her regular gym, her movements were fluid and strong as she exercised, her biceps straining under the weight. She was in a very good shape, her fitness wasn't in question, that was sure. As she rested between sets, Winston approached her.\n\n“Excuse my interruption,\" Winston began, \"I’ve read that you’ve completed quite a few hiking and mountain climbing expeditions?”\n\nA look of surprise flashed on her face, She nodded, panting a bit. “Yes, I’ve been fortunate enough to get around…” she replied.\n\n“You met up with Skylar for a camping trip recently?” Winston probed, her eyes flickered away, a troubled expression crossing her face. “Yes, Skylar invited me.\"\n\n\"I understand there’s been tension in the family recently,\" Winston strayed towards less comfortable territories. \"Skylar had revealed something personal about you to your family, is that right?\"\n\n\"The accusation about a family heirloom…\" Mya tensed, glancing sharply at Winston,\"That was absolutely baseless. Skylar had no reason to accuse me.” She visibly wilted, there was an anger in her voice, fueled by embarrassment. “It’s been a dark chapter in my life.”\n\nWinston nodded, understanding. He had been briefed about Skylar revealing Mya's secret and how the family had started ostracizing her due to the false accusation.\n\nAs Mya picked up her gym bag to leave, Winston noticed her camping gear in the open compartment. The video registered in his mind. The roll of duct tape, an aluminum water bottle, a headlamp but the lead pipe was missing. The same lead pipe that was seen on the CCTV footage when she was packing. It was a small detail but something that stuck with Winston.\n\nOutside the gym, as Winston leaned against his car, one fact bore heavily on his mind - no other cars had been recorded entering or leaving the rainforest by any of the surveillance teams on the day Skylar had been killed. This little nugget of fact had been disturbing him the entire day.\n\nWinston's face hardened while he made the drive back to his office. His mind was whirling; he needed to look at the bigger picture. He was only making sense of each piece that he was uncovering. Whatever was happening was complex, and he had a lot of facts to untangle.\n\nWinston strolled past the line of cabs parked near the city center. He had a destination in mind - the beaten grey vehicle at the end. The driver, Albert, was in the middle of a losing battle with his customer inflow. Not that the local populace didn't patronize taxis. In fact, Skylar was the sweetheart of the city, everyone in town loved her and seemed to prefer her company rather than Albert’s. \n\n“Albert, have some free time for a chat?” Winston asked as he leaned into the cab’s open window. \n\nAlbert’s gaze didn’t leave the rear-view mirror, covered with a pile of sunglasses. “Not like I have a lot of customers waiting, detective,” he grumbled.\n\n\"Skylar seemed to be collecting quite a few of your regulars. You seemed to think she was taking away your livelihood. Did you know her well?\" Winston inquired, ignoring Albert's bitter tone. \n\nAlbert's eyebrows furrowed as he fixated on the cab’s ornament-studded dash. \"We met a few times. I was her cab driver for the day.

Alone in the desert, with the grim encore of death, Philip’s fate felt oddly disconnected from the realities of the bustling metropolis.\n\nWinston pondered over the crucial facts concerning the deceased Philip, particularly those relating to a certain dockworker, Jim. He was reminded of the small piece of evidence that came along with a ledger found in Philip's frozen hands. The ledger chronicled complex illegal smuggling operations. Notably among those was crucial information that it detailed illegal smuggling operations that Jim was involved with at the docks, making the ledger belonging to Jim even more incriminating.\n\nIt was known that Jim often sought solitude in the quiet, sweeping desert that Philip was found. In fact, the day of Philip's death, it was known that Jim had spent a significant amount of time there in the desert, with Philip.\n\nWinston resolved to head to the docks as his initial step. He knew Jim worked there, and was also an active participant in some form of martial arts training.

Giving a carefree shrug, Jim responded, \"Yes, occasionally we get the day off, like today.\"\n\nJim's actions had a disciplined, well-practiced grace, something Winston noted was consistent with someone undergoing martial arts training. When Winston asked about his training, Jim confirmed it with a simple nod.\n\n“So, what about the money you owed Philip?” Winston asked, causing a silence to fall over them, broken only by the sounds of crashing waves.

After a moment’s contemplation, he figured his next action would be to visit the desert where Philip’s body was found.\n\nWinston was walking towards the park with his hands in his pockets, dust from the trail whirling up around him as he went.

The thrift shop had a distinctive sign above its doorway \"Woodrow's Antiques & Collectibles\". \n\nHis destination was not the thrift store though but the old man sitting in the wooden rocking chair on the front porch of the house just behind the store. \n\nSquaring his shoulders, Winston exited his car and approached the man. The old man nodded at his approach. \"Mister Woodrow?\" Winston asked. \n\n\"That I am. And you don't look like a fan of knick-knacks. So I presume you're a detective?\"\n\n\"Guilty as charged,\" Winston replied with a light chuckle. \"Mind if I ask you a few questions?\" \n\n\"It's my property, detective. Love the solitude out here. I usually enjoy my peace but, go ahead,\" Woodrow motioned toward an empty chair opposite him. Winston noticed the hard lines of Woodrow’s arms, the strong muscles present even in his old age. \n\nWinston opened his notebook, \"So, you used to teach martial arts?\"\n\nWoodrow smiled, \"Yes, indeed. For about 40 years. Even collected a few martial arts pieces during my teaching days. Nunchaku among others,\" he said pointing towards a small wooden room, laden with antiques and relics.\n\n\"You still practice?\"\n\n\"Everyday,\" Woodrow responded. \"Keeps me young.\"\n\nWinston checked his notes reminiscing, \"The police called me after Philip mentioned he was invited here to your desert property. You had a visit from him recently, didn't you?\"\n\nWoodrow stiffened at the name. \"Yeah, we got together here at my desert property.\"\n\nWinston lean forward, \"Philip... his actions towards the family, they were consistently abusive, weren't they?\"\n\nWoodrow sighed heavily, \"Yes, that's true. Bad blood doesn't spoil the family, detective. Philip... he made many mistakes, constantly crossing lines. He never even showed an ounce of remorse. It's been difficult, but I love my family dearly and I do everything in my power to protect them,\" Woodrow explained, a hint of pain in his aged eyes.\n\nWinston nodded, jotting down notes, \"Did Philip come alone on his visit?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Woodrow confirmed. \"Needed help with his car, he said. Practically humiliated me in public when it went down. But yeah... he came, and I was here. Alone.\"\n\n\"Well, thank you for your time, Woodrow,\" Winston closed his notebook, standing up. \n\n\"Don't mention it, detective,\" Woodrow replied, attention already diverted to his karate dummy in the corner of his sizeable yard.\n\nWinston gave Woodrow one last glance and then set off back to his car, leaving Woodrow alone to his solitude. As he pulled away, he glanced in his rearview mirror to see Woodrow had already begun his martial arts practice for the day.\n\nWinston squinted as the sun reflected off the desert's sands, making the sandy terrain that much hotter. As someone familiar with this environment, Jim often frequented the desert for solitude. Winston was investigating the intriguing murder of Philip and was heading to meet up with Jim, a local dockworker and a person of interest along with his co-workers, Joe and Sam.\n\nUpon reaching Jim's dwelling in this arid scape, he noticed an interesting thing; despite living near the dock, Jim had a relatively dry, rougher demeanor, more suited to the desert heat. It was as if he often retreated to the desert for solitude. Joining him were Joe and Sam, each with their own questions to ask.\n\nJoe casually started the conversation, asking Jim about his likes and dislikes. \"Any hobbies you particularly enjoy, Jim?\"  Jim chose to talk about the latest football match, his eyes oddly detached despite the commentary. Jim was often evasive when speaking about himself. \"What about your family, Jim?\", Joe continued. Jim responded, as he often does, with \"I'd rather not talk about it.\"\n\nDuring their coffee break, Sam tried to steer their conversation towards a lighter topic. \"Jim,\" he asked, \"what's your favourite film?\" Jim masterfully deflected, changing the subject, commenting about the how the weather reminded him of days when he found solitude in the desert. Noticing this, Sam attempted again, asking Jim about his family, only to receive the same brief, vague answer that always followed inquiries about his private life. \"I'd rather not talk about it,\" was Jim's curt response.\n\nMeanwhile, Winston slowly pushed on his investigation. \"Where were you on the night of 15th?\", Winston asked gently, securing Jim’s response, \"Night of the 15th, officer?

The thrift shop had a distinctive sign above its doorway \\\"Woodrow's Antiques & Collectibles\\\". \\n\\nHis destination was not the thrift store though but the old man sitting in the wooden rocking chair on the front porch of the house just behind the store. \\n\\nSquaring his shoulders, Winston exited his car and approached the man. The old man nodded at his approach. \\\"Mister Woodrow?\\\" Winston asked. \\n\\n\\\"That I am. And you don't look like a fan of knick-knacks. So I presume you're a detective?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Guilty as charged,\\\" Winston replied with a light chuckle. \\\"Mind if I ask you a few questions?\\\" \\n\\n\\\"It's my property, detective.

For about 40 years. Even collected a few martial arts pieces during my teaching days.

You had a visit from him recently, didn't you?\\\"\\n\\nWoodrow stiffened at the name. \\\"Yeah, we got together here at my desert property.\\\"\\n\\nWinston lean forward, \\\"Philip... his actions towards the family, they were consistently abusive, weren't they?\\\"\\n\\nWoodrow sighed heavily, \\\"Yes, that's true. Bad blood doesn't spoil the family, detective. Philip... he made many mistakes, constantly crossing lines. He never even showed an ounce of remorse. It's been difficult, but I love my family dearly and I do everything in my power to protect them,\\\" Woodrow explained, a hint of pain in his aged eyes.\\n\\nWinston nodded, jotting down notes, \\\"Did Philip come alone on his visit?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yeah,\\\" Woodrow confirmed. \\\"Needed help with his car, he said.

Alone.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, thank you for your time, Woodrow,\\\" Winston closed his notebook, standing up. \\n\\n\\\"Don't mention it, detective,\\\" Woodrow replied, attention already diverted to his karate dummy in the corner of his sizeable yard.\\n\\nWinston gave Woodrow one last glance and then set off back to his car, leaving Woodrow alone to his solitude. As he pulled away, he glanced in his rearview mirror to see Woodrow had already begun his martial arts practice for the day.\\n\\nWinston squinted as the sun reflected off the desert's sands, making the sandy terrain that much hotter. As someone familiar with this environment, Jim often frequented the desert for solitude. Winston was investigating the intriguing murder of Philip and was heading to meet up with Jim, a local dockworker and a person of interest along with his co-workers, Joe and Sam.\\n\\nUpon reaching Jim's dwelling in this arid scape, he noticed an interesting thing; despite living near the dock, Jim had a relatively dry, rougher demeanor, more suited to the desert heat. It was as if he often retreated to the desert for solitude. Joining him were Joe and Sam, each with their own questions to ask.\\n\\nJoe casually started the conversation, asking Jim about his likes and dislikes. \\\"Any hobbies you particularly enjoy, Jim?\\\"  Jim chose to talk about the latest football match, his eyes oddly detached despite the commentary. Jim was often evasive when speaking about himself. \\\"What about your family, Jim?\\\", Joe continued. Jim responded, as he often does, with \\\"I'd rather not talk about it.\\\"\\n\\nDuring their coffee break, Sam tried to steer their conversation towards a lighter topic. \\\"Jim,\\\" he asked, \\\"what's your favourite film?\\\" Jim masterfully deflected, changing the subject, commenting about the how the weather reminded him of days when he found solitude in the desert. Noticing this, Sam attempted again, asking Jim about his family, only to receive the same brief, vague answer that always followed inquiries about his private life. \\\"I'd rather not talk about it,\\\" was Jim's curt response.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Winston slowly pushed on his investigation. \\\"Where were you on the night of 15th?\\\", Winston asked gently, securing Jim\\u2019s response, \\\"Night of the 15th, officer? Well, I had no work scheduled that day.\\\" His accent was thick and laced with something Winston couldn't put his finger on.\\n\\nProbing gently, Winston asked. \\\"What were you doing in the desert then?\\\" Jim curtly responded, as he often did when being questioned, with \\\"I'd rather not talk about it.\\\" His walls visibly starting to come up.

Following the cordoned path, the flash of evidence markers catching his eyes, he ran his fingers around the sai in his hand. It was of a unique make, identical to the style used in Freya's martial arts training and not commonly found. There were not many who could handle such a unique weapon, fewer still who owned them.\n\nThe path led him to Freya's home later that day. He was introduced into a crisp and clean living room, save for an empty slot in a display case filled with a fascinating collection of sais. He pondered silently, looking at the missing gap, like a puzzle awaiting to be solved, surely it must have been an important sai to her.\n\nOff the bat, Freya seemed uncomfortable as she started nervously, \"It's good to see you detective, I’m sure you've heard from my friends, they stopped by and I expressed to them my concerns about Jess threating to disclose my secrets. They comforted me, assuring me they would speak to her.”\n\nSeeing that Freya seemed distressed, Winston decided to breach the topic divertedly, “Freya, I notice one is missing.

The one missing held a sentimental value to me, Detective.”\n\n\"Picked up any replacements?\" He asked. “Any practicing recently?”\n\n\"Well, I was at my dojo last week for training,\" Freya offered.\n\nAn interesting tidbit given the recent events. He was drawn by a peculiar object on a side table. A phone, separate from the one Freya had nervously returned to her pocket.\n\n“This your personal phone, Freya?” Winston asked.\n\nFreya’s cheeks reddened, and she quickly replied, “That's my private phone, detective. I find it easier to keep my personal lines separated from the world.” The device was quickly turned off, secure under her watchful gaze.\n\nThroughout the conversation, she seemed uncomfortable whenever he moved too close to anything personal, quickly steering to another topic. Noted, Winston thought, but he was yet to bring up anything about Jess.\n\n“Freya, let me cut to the chase. Jess was found to have written a letter to the local paper about exposing someone's dark secrets. We found a large payment from you to a private investigator. Want to tell me something?\"\n\nShe seemed aghast. \"Detective, Jess had been saying for a while that she had something on me that could ruin me. But we all have our secrets, don’t we? I hired someone to figure out what she had, it was all in my defense!”\n\nWinston took a moment to consider her words. She was a charming woman, but he was trained to look past faces. \"It's good to be honest, Freya,\" he added quietly, placing the sai back in the evidence bag and heading for the door. \n\nOnce back in his car, he noted how stalwartly Freya switched off her private phone when he was around, an action that made him ponder as he started his vehicle to return to base.\n\nWinston had never been a huge fan of pop music, he preferred jazz. Nevertheless, he found himself standing next to a stage that had, the previous night, been vibrating with the sound waves of Leona's music. Leona, a young singer with a dazzling voice that had jetted her to national stardom. Now, just twenty-four hours after her astonishing concert, she was being questioned by Winston, a detective, about the horrific discovery that morning of Jess' lifeless body beside the neighboring swamp.\n\nHe found Leona backstage, looking distraught.\n\n\"Your concert last night,\" Winston spoke patiently. \"The venue was right next to the swamp, am I correct?”\n\nLeona, with her tear-stained mascara, nodded. \"Yes, detective. It was.\"\n\n\"And you had Jess present? Jess with the VIP pass?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Leona replied, her usually confident voice reduced to a mere whisper. \"She even met my sister after the show.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston muttered, trying to keep his tone neutral. \"Because I had a report that she was seen arguing with your sister. She seemed rather threatened.\"\n\nLeona's face was a mask of sadness as she recalled the event. \"My sister? Threatened? I...I saw it happen, she looked scared during their confrontation. Later, Jess also sent a threatening message to my sister after that confrontation. It really upset her and she's been in a distressed state since then.\"\n\nNoticing the grim determination on Leona's face as her thoughts drifted to her sister, Winston probed further. \"I heard you're protective of her,\" he added, watching Leona's reaction.\n\nVisibly shaken, Leona admitted, \"I always have been.\" She dabbed at her eyes with a tissue. \"We only have each other. That's why I didn't object when she wanted to come to my martial arts classes.\"\n\n\"Ah, your martial arts classes,\" Winston interjected. \"I have on my record here that you've been seen attending those regularly over the past months.\"\n\nLeona looked surprised. \"Yes, detective. I needed a way to vent out my stress, and I found martial arts comforting.\"\n\n\"Martial arts, hmm?\" Winston mused aloud. \"Your instructor even mentioned that you've been progressing quite well and he admires your skill with certain weapons. Have you ever handled a sai?\"\n\nFear was written clear on Leona's face as she quietly nodded, understanding where this conversation might be leading to. \"Yes, I have. I just purchased a set and have been training with them. They stay in the dojo, though. I swear.”\n\nLittle did Leona know, but her confession perfectly fit the narrative Winston was trying to weave. He gave nothing away with his stoic expression.\n\n\"I heard,\" he continued slowly, \"that after the concert, Jess was seen headed towards the swamp.\"\n\nShe nodded her head, \"Yeah, people sometimes take that route to avoid the traffic...\"\n\nThe conversation ended, and Winston didn’t probe further.

Following the cordoned path, the flash of evidence markers catching his eyes, he ran his fingers around the sai in his hand.

{"doc_id": 141, "doc": {"narrative": "In the eerie silence of the swamp, Jess was brutally murdered with a sai, leaving Detective Winston sorting through a mire of secrets and lies involving two prime suspects - Leona and Freya.\n\nThe muggy air of the swamp, with its accompanying sounds of buzzing insects and distant croaks of frogs, was a strange backdrop to a brutal crime. Winston's face took on a grim expression as he squinted his eyes against the setting sun, trying to piece together the final gruesome moments of Jess. Found dead near the swamp, the victim's pale hand still clutched a crumpled VIP pass to the recent concert. The singer, Leona, was the main attraction.\n\nDeep in thought, Winston absentmindedly thumbed the murder weapon, a well-crafted sai. The sai was brand new, still wearing the faint scent of the store – it was witty of Leona to buy it so recently... Leona's sai... that was found at the scene. With this new piece of information, he decided to pay the singer a visit during her late-night martial arts class.\n\nEntering the practice room, Winston noticed Leona in the middle of an intense sparring session. Her instructor watched with clear admiration as she dodged blows, her expression intense and focused. She slid into stroke, parrying with a level of expertise that implied countless hours of training. The instructor had remarked on her swift improvement with the sa, speculating on the freshness of her acquisition.\n\nAfter the session, catching her breath with graceful composure, Leona crossed the floor to speak with Winston. As they talked, a subtle shift towards true crime came over their conversation. The sparkle in Leona's eye contrasted against the seriousness of the subject matter. It was clear she was comfortable, almost enthusiastic, addressing crime scenarios, drawing similarities to real events in the documentaries she frequently watched and wrote about. \n\nAs they walked through the venue, Winston observed Leona's possessions, pausing over what appeared to be a well-worn notebook filled with notes upon notes on various crime documentaries. Intriguingly, Winston remembered another reference to this notebook from an event-goer at a recent documentary screening he had attended. He had seen the same notebook in Leona’s hand as she bought her new sai and scribbled away fervently while the documentary ran. \n\nWinston remarked on the close proximity of the concert venue – only a stone’s throw away from the swamp. Leona explained the choice, explaining how she loved the allure of the swamp during night, something atmospheric and eerie about the location that added a unique edge to her concerts... \n\n\"She headed towards the swamp... after the concert, going towards the place she loved.\" The innocent statement caught Winston by surprise. He had stumbled upon someone who had noticed Jess, after Leona's performance, walk blissfully towards the swamp, clutching her VIP pass – the scene of her untimely death.\n\nAs Detective Winston thanked Leona for her time, he looked back at the singer, her recently purchased sai cradled in her forearm skillfully as if it were an extension of her own body. Winston couldn't quite shake off the strange sensation that washed over him. Returning to the stillness of his own vehicle, not yet ready to move on, he just sat there under the starlight, trying to make sense of the eerie dance between the facts that were slowly crafting the narrative to this murder. The story had many more veiled layers waiting to be discovered — and some heavy curtains waiting to be lifted.\n\nWinston found himself standing in Freya's living room, his eyes quickly falling on a display case filled with various medieval weapons including the peculiar missing spot of a sai. Freya positioned herself beside Winston, noting his interest in her unique collection, \"Those ais hold a special place in my heart. A reminder of my martial arts training back in the day. Even last week, I was at the dojo practicing with my favorite, a sai.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston hummed, a non-committal sound as he mentally filed away the information. He peered at the open spot in the case shaping a sai- the exact style like the weapon found in Jess and seemingly missing from the collection. He remembered the local authorities report about a matching weapon disappearing recently. \n\nShifting his focus back on Freya, Winston decided to delve deeper. \"And you frequent the local dojo, am I correct?\" \n\n\"Yes,\" Freya piped, curious. \"I was there just last week.\"\n\n\"And Jess,\" Winston moved on. \"You seem to have spent quite a sum to gain some insight on her.\"\n\nFlustered, Freya breathed heavily, \"Yes, I hired a private investigator. Jess started playing games, bragging about dirt she claimed to have on me.\"\n\n\"How does bird-watching tie into these games?\" Winston questioned, casually dropping a seemingly unrelated question.\n\nTaken aback, Freya chuckled awkwardly, \"Well detective, I do frequent the swamp near here to observe the local birdlife. And yes, my car was indeed spotted parked there recently.\"\n\nSeizing the moment, Winston probed, \"So you would be quite familiar with navigating the swamplands then?\" \n\nFreya gritted her teeth, \"Yes, Detective. As I said, I often go there. My father taught me how to navigate those swamps.\"\n\nNext he opened his folder, producing the letter meant for the local paper, written by Jess. Winston watched as Freya's reactions shifted from surprise to anger, to a controlled calm. It spoke volumes more than her carefully composed words, \"Jess threw accusations left and right, yes. I asked our mutual friends to intervene, to convince her against disclosing these…misconceptions. But, you see, I also heard something disturbing about her. A woman fitting my description was seen heading towards the swamps.” Freya finished, eyes shimmering with unexpected tears.\n\nWinston took a moment to consider her words, nodding slowly, \"You've been very helpful, Freya.

{"doc_id": 142, "doc": {"narrative": "In the tranquil vineyards, Terry's life was brutally snuffed out by a makeshift shiv, and now it's up to seasoned Detective Winston to unravel the truth from suspects Bella and Jose.\n\nThe vineyard was unusually crowded as Winston steadily emerged from his car. Workers swarmed around an old bulldozer — an earsplitting roar clearly disrupting their conversation.\n\nLeading towards the shade of the makeshift structure, Jose — a construction worker at the scene, caught Winston's eye. His brow was furrowed in worry. Laments about his diminishing performance at work were ripe among his co-workers. Noticing a murder of crows flocking in the field, an eerie feeling washed over Winston.\n\nApproaching the blue-collar worker, Winston kicked-off casually, \"Got a minute, Jose?\"\n\nDrawing a deep breath, Jose turned around to shrug, he seemed a bit frazzled. His friendly banter with his co-workers cut short due to a bulldozer malfunctioning, \"It's an early lunch... not like I was doing much today. My boss caught me chattin' instead of workin'.\"\n\nChuckling, Jose bobbed towards the group of his co-workers, who were noticeably enjoying their conversation. \"We've been going at it round the clock to get that wine store ready. Work's been tough lately, my performance has taken a hit, we gotta vent, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" Winston agreed, casually adding, \"Isn't Terry your boss?\"\n\n\"Technically, yes,\" sighed Jose, rubbing his neck nervously. \"He owns this whole place,\" gesturing around the vineyard. \"We had a... disagreement this morning. He accused me of stealing from the building site, falsifying work hours. Even threatened to fire me.\"\n\nAs Jose's voice trailed off, Winston observed, \"Sounds tough.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Jose replied quietly. \"The man even suspects me for the murder that happened here last week, during my shift. If Terry fires me... everything comes crashing down. This is the main work I've got right now... I can't afford to lose it.\"\n\nWinston nodded understandingly and asked him if Terry, who was also present during the murder event, was around the vineyard at this time, to which Jose confirmed.\n\nAfter reassuring Jose, he'd look into the matter, Winston began walking towards his car. Just as he was leaving, the obnoxious screech of the faulty bulldozer marked the end of an early lunch break.\n\nWinston sipped his black coffee as he stared out of his aging police cruiser, eyeing the sprawling vineyard and thinking about Terry. Reports had come in of a heated exchange between Terry and Bella. A scenario that happened right after Terry caught Bella red-handed with a bottle of rare, expensive wine she hadn't paid for. An intern. Bella, whose name had been brought up more and more frequently in recent times due to her increasing thieving activities. \n\nShe hadn't left the vineyard that day. Bella, who was spotted near the shed just minutes before Terry's body was found there. It was adding up, and something heavy was pressing on Winston's gut. He quietly exited his cruiser and walked over to Bella, who was diligently maintaining the vineyard's tools after work. \n\n\"Ma'am,\" Winston began. His greeting was met with a simple nod from Bella.\n\n\"Bella, correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir,\" she replied.\n\n\"You were here all day?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Everyone around here can tell you that,\" she murmured. \n\nAn old red-and-green painted shed stood in the distance. He knew Bella had the privilege of going in and out without supervision. A luxury that troubled him, especially given her recent knack for stealing. \n\n\"Busy day today?\" Winston asked, glancing at Bella's hands.\n\n\"Always. I keep these tools as clean and sharp as possible,\" she replied, holding up a newly sharpened pruner. Her delicate hands belied the hardened steel of the instruments. \n\nWinston nodded, casting his gaze to one of the metal figurines intricately sculpted by Bella herself. \n\n\"You do this?\" he asked, pointing. \n\nBella nodded, a small smile flashing across her face. She seemed to relish the precision, the skill required, and the metalwork. It was clear she was good at this. His eyes narrowed slightly as he put the figurine back down.\n\nHer penchant for stealing wasn't just limited to the tools or anything she could lay her hands on. It was whispered around the vineyard that Bella had a keen taste for the wine here. Especially the rare and pricey varieties, which had been disappearing more frequently than before. Terry wasn't a fan though, especially after catching her in the act. Winston had found himself unusually bothered by what was open knowledge. Particularly, Terry's threat to report Bella to management if it continued.\n\nOn his way back to his cruiser, Winston remembered a particularly vivid memory from his briefing; Terry shouting at Bella right in front of the shed. The memory sent a chill running down his spine. He wore a stoic face in front of her, nodded in acknowledgment, and walked away. His gut was telling him that she had more to say, and he planned to stick around.

Work's been tough lately, my performance has taken a hit, we gotta vent, right?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, of course,\\\" Winston agreed, casually adding, \\\"Isn't Terry your boss?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Technically, yes,\\\" sighed Jose, rubbing his neck nervously. \\\"He owns this whole place,\\\" gesturing around the vineyard. \\\"We had a... disagreement this morning. He accused me of stealing from the building site, falsifying work hours. Even threatened to fire me.\\\"\\n\\nAs Jose's voice trailed off, Winston observed, \\\"Sounds tough.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, sir,\\\" Jose replied quietly. \\\"The man even suspects me for the murder that happened here last week, during my shift. If Terry fires me... everything comes crashing down. This is the main work I've got right now... I can't afford to lose it.\\\"\\n\\nWinston nodded understandingly and asked him if Terry, who was also present during the murder event, was around the vineyard at this time, to which Jose confirmed.\\n\\nAfter reassuring Jose, he'd look into the matter, Winston began walking towards his car. Just as he was leaving, the obnoxious screech of the faulty bulldozer marked the end of an early lunch break.\\n\\nWinston sipped his black coffee as he stared out of his aging police cruiser, eyeing the sprawling vineyard and thinking about Terry. Reports had come in of a heated exchange between Terry and Bella. A scenario that happened right after Terry caught Bella red-handed with a bottle of rare, expensive wine she hadn't paid for. An intern. Bella, whose name had been brought up more and more frequently in recent times due to her increasing thieving activities. \\n\\nShe hadn't left the vineyard that day. Bella, who was spotted near the shed just minutes before Terry's body was found there. It was adding up, and something heavy was pressing on Winston's gut. He quietly exited his cruiser and walked over to Bella, who was diligently maintaining the vineyard's tools after work. \\n\\n\\\"Ma'am,\\\" Winston began. His greeting was met with a simple nod from Bella.\\n\\n\\\"Bella, correct?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Sir,\\\" she replied.\\n\\n\\\"You were here all day?\\\"\\n\\nShe nodded. \\\"Everyone around here can tell you that,\\\" she murmured. \\n\\nAn old red-and-green painted shed stood in the distance. He knew Bella had the privilege of going in and out without supervision. A luxury that troubled him, especially given her recent knack for stealing. \\n\\n\\\"Busy day today?\\\" Winston asked, glancing at Bella's hands.\\n\\n\\\"Always. I keep these tools as clean and sharp as possible,\\\" she replied, holding up a newly sharpened pruner. Her delicate hands belied the hardened steel of the instruments. \\n\\nWinston nodded, casting his gaze to one of the metal figurines intricately sculpted by Bella herself. \\n\\n\\\"You do this?\\\" he asked, pointing. \\n\\nBella nodded, a small smile flashing across her face. She seemed to relish the precision, the skill required, and the metalwork. It was clear she was good at this. His eyes narrowed slightly as he put the figurine back down.\\n\\nHer penchant for stealing wasn't just limited to the tools or anything she could lay her hands on. It was whispered around the vineyard that Bella had a keen taste for the wine here. Especially the rare and pricey varieties, which had been disappearing more frequently than before. Terry wasn't a fan though, especially after catching her in the act. Winston had found himself unusually bothered by what was open knowledge. Particularly, Terry's threat to report Bella to management if it continued.\\n\\nOn his way back to his cruiser, Winston remembered a particularly vivid memory from his briefing; Terry shouting at Bella right in front of the shed. The memory sent a chill running down his spine. He wore a stoic face in front of her, nodded in acknowledgment, and walked away. His gut was telling him that she had more to say, and he planned to stick around. Somewhat of a sixth sense, he attributed it to his years on the force.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Bella\\n(b) - Jose\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(a) - Bella"]], "filtered_resps": ["(a)"], "doc_hash": "f2daecc91c30b01bcdcb6d795f2729947ca484dc9239bf52f1c8894f1766f5ae", "prompt_hash": "2c0b24ec0882b31173432bfbc19b52d9d980149cd59faf23e0ddd9743953fb22", "target_hash": "e300f251dc09073a9781733cd99758d04a98290157b77fb5c4a986b123900fc6", "exact_match": 0.0}

{"doc_id": 145, "doc": {"narrative": "In the heart of a labyrinth, Samuel lay lifeless, a corkscrew marking his end, throwing Detective Winston into a twisted web of clues, suspects, and secrets.\n\nWinston found himself standing before the grand old labyrinth, a strange sense of nervous excitement bubbling up within him. His next lead, Rachel, had been seen here with the late Samuel not too long ago.\n\nWinston adjusted his hat and proceeded towards the labyrinth's house. According to the intel he had received, Rachel was a tenant and he needed to dig deeper. \n\nAs he was led through the maze-like building, Rachel's familiarity with the structure was made clear to him. She had free access, considering her status as a tenant. \n\nIn the grand living room of the labyrinth, he spotted a collection of many intricate corkscrews casually displayed in a glass cabinet. The officer who had briefed him had mentioned Rachel's eclectic collection, her acknowledged ability to open wine bottles with one and her reputation as a sommelier; a mastery which requires a sophisticated expertise with corkscrews.\n\nLater, as Winston requested an opportunity to talk, Rachel's past encounters with the law were addressed. She had been in cuffs before on account of murder and the homicide detectives at the station had previously linked several victims to Rachel’s unique pattern of killing—using a corkscrew as a weapon, a pattern that was too specific to belong to anyone else but her.\n\nJust as Winston was about to cut through to the quick, he noticed a piece of paper in the corner of Rachel's otherwise neat room. Peering closer, he spotted Samuel's name at the top of the list. It was confirmed - Samuel was on Rachel's list of confirmed victims that matched her cruel corkscrew method.\n\nThen came the disturbing facts; the ones that didn't sit right with Winston. Among them was the undeniable likeness of poor Samuel to Rachel's former victims. Matching to the tee, in fact, to the known victims, who all bore the mark of her corkscrew.\n\n\"Samuel was last seen here, wasn't he?\" Winston asked, which Rachel confirmed. She also admitted that they had entered the labyrinth together.\n\nBut the most chilling revelation for Winston was the fact that no one else was known to have been in the labyrinth. It was just them, Samuel and Rachel. The isolation within the labyrinth had always made it a place of mystery and unease. It was as if the labyrinth in itself was involved in the elaborate dance of death.\n\nAs he departed, Winston wondered why an otherwise forty-something pleasant woman like Rachel, a reputed sommelier, would resort to such chilling activities. But that was the puzzle to solve; the reason for his dogged pursuit of the truth.\n\nDetective Winston leaned against the marble labyrinth walls, picturing the lost Samuel stumbling through, only to find his demise. There was always something eerie about labyrinths. They were designed to lose you. Now, they seemed to encapsulate the mystery that lay before him.\n\nWalking away from the labyrinth, he climbed back into his trusty black Sedan and guided it to Charlotte's studio. He had been told by his colleagues about Charlotte, the celebrated local choreographer. She was reportedly seen distinctively in public places such as shopping malls and parks, with a notepad in her hand, staining the pages fervently as she observed the natural movements of the people around her. She would practice her noted movements again and again until she perfected them for her choreographies.\n\nShe wasn't just famous in the artistic locale of the town, but also a known face in the numerous wine-tasting events around. Her appreciation for fine wine, as was apparent by her regular visits to these soirees, added to her persona. Many would see her, savoring the flavor, discussing the notes and delicacies of the fermented grapes. That's what made her request for him to bring a bottle of red wine in their next meeting less surprising.\n\nThe studio was buzzing as Winston entered. Charlotte was delicately supervising her dancers, commanding the room with a certain grace. As the bass-heavy music dwindled down, he seized the opportunity to gain her attention. “Charlotte?” Winston introduced himself.\n\n\"Detective, please do go ahead and sit,\" Charlotte gestured, quickly excusing herself to handle a delivery that had just arrived. She opened boxes and packages with a certain familiarity, not unusual for someone who received ample parcels daily. What caught his attention; however, was that she was using a corkscrew to slice open the packages. Uncouth, but practical in some way. Never in his line of work had he seen a corkscrew as a package opener.\n\nAs Winston conversed with Charlotte, her defiant love for her sister became evident. There was an uncomfortable history with Samuel where Charlotte's sister played the victim to his harassments. Winston could see the furious protectiveness in Charlotte's eyes as she spoke about her sister's distress under Samuel's provocations\n\n\"We have had this conversation before, Detective,\" Charlotte perched herself on a stool, her excitement dimming into a serious frown. \"I confronted Samuel multiple times about his behavior, and I am not shy about arguing for my sister's protection.”\n\nHer ogle darted around the room before landing back on Winston, glossier. “Can we change the subject?” she pleaded. Sensing her growing discomfort, he agreed and asked about her choreography instead. \n\n“Ah, that’s one of my favorite topics!” She sighed happily, reminiscent of a fine wine savant in a tasting session. \"I observe people's movements in different public places like malls, parks, and even wine-tasting events. I take notes, try them out multiple times until they feel right and incorporate them into my routines. It’s like I’m borrowing from the world and making something beautiful of it,” Her face glowed with dedication, shadowed by an uneasy sadness.\n\nAs Winston prepared to exit the studio, Charlotte requested him for a favor. “Detective, next time you come here, bring a bottle of red along?” A smile painted her lips, gleaming eyes suggesting an implied twinship between the detective and the world of fine wine. “Consider it my fee for the trouble,” she added, chortling softly, her eyes dewy.\n\nAs Winston drove away, he remembered her passion carefully stored in the paper-notes, her love for movements and her wines, and her fiery protection towards her sister.

His next lead, Rachel, had been seen here with the late Samuel not too long ago.\\n\\nWinston adjusted his hat and proceeded towards the labyrinth's house. According to the intel he had received, Rachel was a tenant and he needed to dig deeper. \\n\\nAs he was led through the maze-like building, Rachel's familiarity with the structure was made clear to him. She had free access, considering her status as a tenant. \\n\\nIn the grand living room of the labyrinth, he spotted a collection of many intricate corkscrews casually displayed in a glass cabinet. The officer who had briefed him had mentioned Rachel's eclectic collection, her acknowledged ability to open wine bottles with one and her reputation as a sommelier; a mastery which requires a sophisticated expertise with corkscrews.\\n\\nLater, as Winston requested an opportunity to talk, Rachel's past encounters with the law were addressed. She had been in cuffs before on account of murder and the homicide detectives at the station had previously linked several victims to Rachel\\u2019s unique pattern of killing\\u2014using a corkscrew as a weapon, a pattern that was too specific to belong to anyone else but her.\\n\\nJust as Winston was about to cut through to the quick, he noticed a piece of paper in the corner of Rachel's otherwise neat room. Peering closer, he spotted Samuel's name at the top of the list. It was confirmed - Samuel was on Rachel's list of confirmed victims that matched her cruel corkscrew method.\\n\\nThen came the disturbing facts; the ones that didn't sit right with Winston. Among them was the undeniable likeness of poor Samuel to Rachel's former victims. Matching to the tee, in fact, to the known victims, who all bore the mark of her corkscrew.\\n\\n\\\"Samuel was last seen here, wasn't he?\\\" Winston asked, which Rachel confirmed. She also admitted that they had entered the labyrinth together.\\n\\nBut the most chilling revelation for Winston was the fact that no one else was known to have been in the labyrinth. It was just them, Samuel and Rachel. The isolation within the labyrinth had always made it a place of mystery and unease. It was as if the labyrinth in itself was involved in the elaborate dance of death.\\n\\nAs he departed, Winston wondered why an otherwise forty-something pleasant woman like Rachel, a reputed sommelier, would resort to such chilling activities. But that was the puzzle to solve; the reason for his dogged pursuit of the truth.\\n\\nDetective Winston leaned against the marble labyrinth walls, picturing the lost Samuel stumbling through, only to find his demise. There was always something eerie about labyrinths. They were designed to lose you. Now, they seemed to encapsulate the mystery that lay before him.\\n\\nWalking away from the labyrinth, he climbed back into his trusty black Sedan and guided it to Charlotte's studio. He had been told by his colleagues about Charlotte, the celebrated local choreographer. She was reportedly seen distinctively in public places such as shopping malls and parks, with a notepad in her hand, staining the pages fervently as she observed the natural movements of the people around her. She would practice her noted movements again and again until she perfected them for her choreographies.\\n\\nShe wasn't just famous in the artistic locale of the town, but also a known face in the numerous wine-tasting events around. Her appreciation for fine wine, as was apparent by her regular visits to these soirees, added to her persona. Many would see her, savoring the flavor, discussing the notes and delicacies of the fermented grapes. That's what made her request for him to bring a bottle of red wine in their next meeting less surprising.\\n\\nThe studio was buzzing as Winston entered.

{"doc_id": 150, "doc": {"narrative": "In the heart of a rainforest, Peyton's life was brutally ended with a hatchet, pulling grizzled Detective Winston into a twisted web of deceit featuring suspects Bruce and Norris.\n\nWinston took a careful look at the grim scene. The deceased, Peyton, was found with a gruesome hatchet wound deep in the heart of the rainforest.\n\nWhile sorting through the information at hand, Winston recalled a bit of crucial info about the suspect - Bruce, Peyton's partner in their shared illicit business. Bruce had mentioned that the day Peyton was found, he had been alone in the rainforest. A rumored confession and potential surrender by Peyton, and the stolen goods Peyton found stashed away, kept echoing in Winston's mind.\n\nAs the detective stepped away from the lamenting scene, he called in to schedule an interview with the partner, Bruce. He was known to visit the rainforest often, sometimes for solitude, sometimes under the guise of his illicit activities.\n\nMeeting Bruce at the entrance to the rainforest the following day, Winston sized him up. Nothing about his demeanor suggested guilt. Despite fearing the legal consequences of his actions, there was a calm about Bruce. For someone raised in the rainforest, he seemed one with the environment, he was comfortable in it.\n\nWinston asked Bruce about his usual activities in his favorite retreat, prompting him to say, \"I usually just like to be alone here, sir. A few chops here and there with my hatchet helps maintain the paths and keeps me busy.\"\n\nBruce’s answer inclined Winston to inquire, “And where is this hatchet now?” \n\nWith a frown, Bruce replied, “I couldn’t find it today, sir. I usually keep it well maintained and in its usual spot.”\n\nTheir talk was interrupted by a passerby, jogging down a path. After briefly chatting about the area and visitor trends they noticed, the jogger mentioned that they hadn't seen anyone else in the rainforest that particular day, let alone someone leaving. The jogger left. Bruce turned back to Winston and shared, \"Nobody usually notices me here, even when leaving the rainforest. It’s quite secluded.”\n\nThe thought of Peyton's gruesome death by the hatchet wound came back to Winston's mind. He abruptly thanked Bruce for his time and walked away.\n\nThe rainforest echoed with the weighted silence of the untold, and, as Winston ventured back to the city, a haunting thought lingered. The quiet, confident Bruce, with his missing hatchet, was confirmed to have been alone the last day Peyton was seen alive, and as the jogger had informed, unseen when he left the rainforest; the same day Peyton died.\n\nWinston examined the manifest from Norris's ferry one final time. It matched up with what he already knew: Peyton had indeed been aboard Norris's ferry on the day he was killed. Winston took one last look at the document before folding it and tucking it away into his coat pocket.\n\nNorris, the ferry captain, had a reputation amongst the barflies at his favorite local watering hole. They'd often overheard him detailing possibly too realistic scenes from the books they discussed at his thriller murder novel themed book club. Norris would get into specifics that made the members uncomfortable, his eyes often taking on an excited shine while he spoke of these gruesome and too-detailed-to-be-fiction murder scenes.\n\nTapping his notepad with a worn-down pen, Winston glanced up as Norris approached. Clad in his usual captain's garb and appearing a bit rough around the edges from years of running the ferry. Norris acted as the key traveling back and forth to the local rainforest, the last known place Peyton was seen alive.\n\n\"Captain Norris?\" Winston asked, even though he already knew the answer. Norris nodded in confirmation, his steady gaze meeting Winston's. \"Been doing this job for years,\" Norris said, a hint of pride reflected in his voice.\n\n\"It's a sturdy vessel you have,\" Winston commented as he gestured towards the ferry, his eyes landing on a standalone toolbox propped up near the bow. One item in particular stood out from the rest— a hatchet, well-used and worn, clear evidence of its frequent use in the maintenance of the ship under Norris's experienced hands.\n\n\"Ah, yes. That's Gertrude,\" Norris responded, referencing the hatchet, drawing Winston's attention back to him.

The deceased, Peyton, was found with a gruesome hatchet wound deep in the heart of the rainforest.\\n\\nWhile sorting through the information at hand, Winston recalled a bit of crucial info about the suspect - Bruce, Peyton's partner in their shared illicit business. Bruce had mentioned that the day Peyton was found, he had been alone in the rainforest. A rumored confession and potential surrender by Peyton, and the stolen goods Peyton found stashed away, kept echoing in Winston's mind.\\n\\nAs the detective stepped away from the lamenting scene, he called in to schedule an interview with the partner, Bruce. He was known to visit the rainforest often, sometimes for solitude, sometimes under the guise of his illicit activities.\\n\\nMeeting Bruce at the entrance to the rainforest the following day, Winston sized him up. Nothing about his demeanor suggested guilt. Despite fearing the legal consequences of his actions, there was a calm about Bruce. For someone raised in the rainforest, he seemed one with the environment, he was comfortable in it.\\n\\nWinston asked Bruce about his usual activities in his favorite retreat, prompting him to say, \\\"I usually just like to be alone here, sir. A few chops here and there with my hatchet helps maintain the paths and keeps me busy.\\\"\\n\\nBruce\\u2019s answer inclined Winston to inquire, \\u201cAnd where is this hatchet now?\\u201d \\n\\nWith a frown, Bruce replied, \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t find it today, sir. I usually keep it well maintained and in its usual spot.\\u201d\\n\\nTheir talk was interrupted by a passerby, jogging down a path. After briefly chatting about the area and visitor trends they noticed, the jogger mentioned that they hadn't seen anyone else in the rainforest that particular day, let alone someone leaving. The jogger left. Bruce turned back to Winston and shared, \\\"Nobody usually notices me here, even when leaving the rainforest. It\\u2019s quite secluded.\\u201d\\n\\nThe thought of Peyton's gruesome death by the hatchet wound came back to Winston's mind. He abruptly thanked Bruce for his time and walked away.\\n\\nThe rainforest echoed with the weighted silence of the untold, and, as Winston ventured back to the city, a haunting thought lingered. The quiet, confident Bruce, with his missing hatchet, was confirmed to have been alone the last day Peyton was seen alive, and as the jogger had informed, unseen when he left the rainforest; the same day Peyton died.\\n\\nWinston examined the manifest from Norris's ferry one final time. It matched up with what he already knew: Peyton had indeed been aboard Norris's ferry on the day he was killed. Winston took one last look at the document before folding it and tucking it away into his coat pocket.\\n\\nNorris, the ferry captain, had a reputation amongst the barflies at his favorite local watering hole. They'd often overheard him detailing possibly too realistic scenes from the books they discussed at his thriller murder novel themed book club. Norris would get into specifics that made the members uncomfortable, his eyes often taking on an excited shine while he spoke of these gruesome and too-detailed-to-be-fiction murder scenes.\\n\\nTapping his notepad with a worn-down pen, Winston glanced up as Norris approached. Clad in his usual captain's garb and appearing a bit rough around the edges from years of running the ferry. Norris acted as the key traveling back and forth to the local rainforest, the last known place Peyton was seen alive.\\n\\n\\\"Captain Norris?\\\" Winston asked, even though he already knew the answer. Norris nodded in confirmation, his steady gaze meeting Winston's. \\\"Been doing this job for years,\\\" Norris said, a hint of pride reflected in his voice.\\n\\n\\\"It's a sturdy vessel you have,\\\" Winston commented as he gestured towards the ferry, his eyes landing on a standalone toolbox propped up near the bow. One item in particular stood out from the rest\\u2014 a hatchet, well-used and worn, clear evidence of its frequent use in the maintenance of the ship under Norris's experienced hands.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, yes. That's Gertrude,\\\" Norris responded, referencing the hatchet, drawing Winston's attention back to him. Considering he was the only ferry giving rides to that rainforest, it was crucial Norris kept the ferry in good shape.\\n\\nWinston then redirected the conversation, \\\"We have a record of a Peyton.

But solving cases like these held an irreplaceable allure to Winston’s trouble-stricken mind.\n\nHis first lead came in the form of an irregular character by the name Clarence. A truck driver who works long hours, regularly present near the synagogue amongst other stops, and oddly enough, an ardent collector of obituaries. Often, community members would speak in hushed tones of Clarence’s nightly tears shed over obituaries, forming an image of emotional investment over people he had no known connection with. Despite their gossiping, none of them had ever heard of Clarence befriending or nurturing a relationship with anyone mentioned in the obituaries. In fact, during their investigation, the police found no documented ties of Clara with the deceased individuals, either.\n\nOver black coffee and stale bread in a nearby diner, Detective Winston conversed with Clarence. \"So you’re a truck driver?

{"doc_id": 153, "doc": {"narrative": "In the hushed sanctity of a bustling synagogue, Vanessa's life was abruptly ended with a common tool, and now Detective Winston must unravel the tangled threads of suspicion around Ivy and Clarence.\n\nWinston wiped his sweat-covered brow with the back of his sleeve. It was a particularly hot day, and the endless rows of hardware supplies inside the store did little to relieve the heat.\n\nFrom afar, he spotted Ivy, her expression soft, as she demonstrated how to properly use a screwdriver to a customer. The toolbelt around her hips, full of screwdrivers, signalled her daily routine. She handled the tool with such familiarity that it was almost intimidating. After a little while, the customer thanked Ivy and left, providing an opportunity for Winston to approach her.\n\n\"Miss Ivy, I presume,\" Winston said, donning a slight smile.\n\n\"That's me,\" She replied, her brow furrowing slightly. “Do I know you?”\n\n“No, we've never met. I’m detective Winston.” He turned to see a toolbelt, a mirror image of Ivy's, containing the same make of screwdriver Ivy was demonstrating earlier, hanging near the counter.\n\nTurning his attention back to Ivy, he asked, “Regular at the synagogue, aren’t you? The same one Vanessa used to attend with you every week?\"\n\nA slight wrinkle formed between her brows. \"Yes, every week,\" she confirmed.\n\nHer composure still intact, Winston continued, \"You arrived before everyone else at the synagogue yesterday, correct? On the unfortunate day when Vanessa was murdered there?\"\n\nA shiver of what could have been fear, or maybe sadness, passed over Ivy's face. \"Yes, I was,\" she admitted, her voice shaky.\n\n“You were seen crying uncontrollably during the eulogy, despite not personally knowing Vanessa?”\n\n“The community is close-knit and Vanessa was part of it,” Ivy replied. “Her murder was devastating.”\n\nWinston nodded, “Her coffin was left unattended and open for a while. That's when you were observed rummaging through her belongings just after the murder. What were you looking for, Miss Ivy?”\n\nIvy looked away, unwilling to answer. Winston noticed, and continued questioning. His gaze eventually settled on an open sign that read, ‘Proud to serve this community since 1995’.\n\n“I’ll be needing you for further questioning, Miss Ivy.\"\n\nWith that, Winston left the shop, trying to disregard the fact that he wore the same look of sorrow as likely everyone in the community.\n\nWinston sipped on lukewarm coffee studying the report in his hands.

It was a particularly hot day, and the endless rows of hardware supplies inside the store did little to relieve the heat.\\n\\nFrom afar, he spotted Ivy, her expression soft, as she demonstrated how to properly use a screwdriver to a customer. The toolbelt around her hips, full of screwdrivers, signalled her daily routine. She handled the tool with such familiarity that it was almost intimidating. After a little while, the customer thanked Ivy and left, providing an opportunity for Winston to approach her.\\n\\n\\\"Miss Ivy, I presume,\\\" Winston said, donning a slight smile.\\n\\n\\\"That's me,\\\" She replied, her brow furrowing slightly. \\u201cDo I know you?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cNo, we've never met.

It was a martial arts weapon distinct in its deadly simplicity, known all too well by the martial arts community. \n\nWinston mulled over the circumstances surrounding Leroy's death. Leroy had gotten married to Clayton's ex-wife shortly after they had filed for divorce.\n\nLeaving the scene, Winston drove the short distance to the local dojo owned and run by a man by the name of Clayton. Clayton was an ex-husband to the recent bride of Leroy, and an avid martial arts instructor. According to whispers among the locals, he seemed to be a man still inherently in love with his ex-wife, a flame that lulled even after their love had supposedly extinguished.\n\nOn driving to the dojo, nostalgic flashes of visits to the local bar sprung forth in Winston's mind. Memories of how locals had on multiple occasions, narrated tales of Clayton exploring the swamp alone and of how he also ran survival tours there. On the day of the murder, many people at the local bar saw Clayton getting into his car alone, painting a picture of his solitary routine.\n\nUpon arriving, he found Clayton, kneeling before an illustrious collection of martial arts weaponry, that included a sai, the same weapon used in the murder of Leroy.  \n\n\"So, you collect these?\" Winston asked, nodding at the weapons.\n\n\"It's part of the job,\" Clayton responded as he carefully set down the sai, \"having a wide knowledge of martial arts weaponry. But yes, I have developed a personal collection.\" \n\nWinston ventured further, \"I heard you run survival tours in the swamp.\"\n\nClayton chuckled. \"Oh yes. I love exploring the swamp. It's like it's a part of me.

Can't deny it stung a bit.\"  \n\"But you'd want her back--\"\n\nWithout waiting for Winston to finish, Clayton interjected. \"Yes, I would. But she made it clear she doesn't want a reconciliation as long as Leroy is around.\" \n\nAs Winston left the dojo, he began to storyboard the potential narrative. A man still in love with his ex-wife who wed another man right after their divorce, seen alone on the day of her new husband’s murder, with a confession that the ex-wife did not want to reconcile as long as Leroy was alive. He had a lot to ponder.\n\nDetective Winston strode into the lobby of the martial arts gym, taking in the sights of many people practicing their moves, some more graceful than others. His attention quickly moved to a woman near the back of the room, demonstrating a jarring, yet elegant, technique to her student with a sai. Recognizing her from a picture at his precinct, Winston confirmed it was Madelyn.\n\nHe recalled Leroy’s fitness schedule, and his plans to switch personal trainers, leaving Madelyn for her biggest competitor. Friends had mentioned conversations Leroy had with Madelyn's rival. Winston also knew from his sources, she had been in the vicinity when Leroy was on the phone discussing the change.\n\nMadelyn had a reputation of changing her hair practically every week.

Madelyn agreed to go to the local coffee shop for a friendly chat.

A technique he knew was the cause of Leroy’s death.\n\nHer unique weapon choice hadn't really surprised him.

The sight of Cecilia's body, found long after the time Stuart was noted alone at the site lent a sense of unease that still imprinted in his mind from the crime scene photos.\n\nThere was a strange quiet that persisted in the area as the evening shadows coalesced further into night.

Usually, his line of work didn't involve tracking down suspects in airport lobbies, but such were the circumstances - with available investigation time dwindling when it came to this particular murder.\n\n\"Well, you look a little nervous there, Stuart,\" Winston observed casually, curious about the noticeable discomfort emanating from the otherwise composed electrician.\n\n\"Just... I hate flying,\" Stuart offered. His eyes darted to the grimy airport terminal windows without meeting Winston's leveled gaze.\n\nDecades of police work allowed Winston to judge when someone, like Stuart, was being evasive about the truth. The seasoned detective decided to switch tactics for now. \"You know, Stuart, I've heard you're quite the hand with voltage. Been working as an electrician for several years?\"\n\nStuart nodded. \"Yes, sir. Always got my own set of tools. Everything I need to get the job done, including my axe.\" His fingers twitched slightly as he mentioned the tool, akin to a pianist remembering a familiar melody. Perfect for cutting electrical cables when necessary. \n\nWinston took note of this reaction and continued. \"Big day today, huh? Received a call to fix a power outage at the remote chalet. No other workers, no inhabitants. Just you with all your tools, including that axe of yours.\" He had to be careful with his words, especially considering Stuart's tendency to withhold personal information.\n\n\"Yes, that's right. It was at Cecilia's chalet. Power was out the entire day. Had to bring my equipment with me. Cutting off the old cables was messy work, but the axe made it a tad easier,\" Stuart looked slightly away again at the mention of the now tragically departed Cecilia. \n\nWinston let that dissipate into the stale air before continuing. \"And shortly after that, they found her. Found her in that very chalet.\"\n\nThe sudden silence suggested he finally got under Stuart's skin. However, before Winston could get another word in, the overhead speakers bellowed out the final call for Stuart's flight. \n\nWith his head still bowed low, Stuart stood up, hefted his luggage, and muttered, \"I'd best be going.\"\n\nWinston watched him walk briskly towards the gangway, hands gripping his carry-on bag tightly.

Waving off the last crime scene investigator, he stepped inside the chalet, processing the eerie silence.\n\nCecilia was a student at the local school where Alice, suspect in question, was a counselor. Alice had been not only on the verge of significant change in her professional landscape, but was about to lose her job due to a recent scandal. A noun as unstable as scandal, indeed. It turns out that the scandal she was embroiled in was about grade-changing; documents uncovered by Cecilia suggested Alice's involvement. That sort of behavior doesn't sit well with school authorities, because it undermines the values and ethics they strive to instill in their students.\n\nAs he skimmed through Cecilia's schedule for that day, he noted that Alice was the only appointment, and it was Alice who'd put it in the calendar. He remembered Alice as one of the leading figures on the school's camping trips. He'd even seen her demonstrating axe skills to the kids, the very same axe which had been laying untouched until recently in the school's woodshop.\n\nWinston had been informed that Alice had previously been seen carrying an axe from that shop. An axe could be used for chopping wood, maybe, but in a setting such as this one, it was a grim and dominating presence, a marker of something far more sinister. This, however, was pure conjecture.\n\n“Alice has always been very active with the students – often taking them out for camping trips.” Winston mused to himself. He tried to imagine the scene: Alice presiding over a group of children, expertly wielding an axe to chop wood for a bonfire, perhaps.\n\nAside from this scandal, Cecilia had unintentionally stumbled further into a dark web of secrets, uncovering evidence of Alice's extramarital affair. That sort of discovery could wreak havoc on a school counselor's reputation, with potential to bring about more devastating consequences.\n\nParting the drapes, Winston watched as the sunset turned the icy landscape warm shades of peach and gold.

A scandal, an affair, an impending job loss and now, a murder to deal with. As Winston packed up his notes and headed out, he had Eden, his secretary, dial Alice's number.\n\nBefore leaving the desolate chalet, Winston allowed himself a final speculative glance at the crime scene.

Help 'em grab a bite at the end of their flight, you know?\" Bryan mentioned, chopping some tough ingredients with his hatchet. From his posture and technique, it was clear he knew his way around such a tool.\n\n\"The same way you've been helping yourself to the petty cash, I see,\" Winston casually remarked, causing Bryan to stumble a bit, resulting in him nicking his finger slightly.\n\n\"No, that's not...\" Bryan lapsed before continuing, his hands trembling.

Those weren’t just pranks, he's been doing everything in his power to make a fool out of me.\"\n\n\"I suppose you were near the gliding site before the incident happened?\" Bryan nodded, confirming that he indeed was, \"Yeah, I was there prepping up the food and drinks we're serving today.\"\n\nIn the pink-tinged evening light, Winston walked back from the crime scene towards his car. Whispers of unfriendly pranks, public humiliation, and petty thefts filled the air. Across his mind slipped an image of Travis, alone, soaring in the air.\n\nDetective Winston sat back in his chair, brows furrowed as he perused the pile of evidence on the sturdy wooden table. He meticulously studied the hapless victim - Travis, a man recently celebrated for his acrobatic skills on a paraglider, a man whose life was cut short at a paragliding site with a hatchet.\n\nHis suspect was intriguing, to say the least. Everett he was known as, a bright-faced man whose talent lay in the realm of woodworking methods. Interestingly, a majority of his time was dedicated to curating displays of impeccable craftsmanship at the local woodworking museum.\n\nUpon arriving at the museum, Winston took a mental note of the serene aura surrounding Everett. His hands, worn from years of delicate crafting, fondly caressed the various tools in his personal collection. Quiet admiration sparked in his eyes as he studied each piece. The hatchet, which was the murder weapon, had been sourced from this same collection.\n\nEverett had a dubious past, considering he had been privy to the office that housed a drawer filled with FFID cards, each bearing a different alias. The coincidental catalog of names was a matching list to Everett's known aliases.\n\nIn a room full of bustling conference attendees, Fraser, a local woodworker, casually recollected an incident about an 'Edward' who introduced himself during a conversation at a conference. This character sketch fit Everett impeccably. Yet another time, Winston learned, Everett introduced himself as 'Eric' within a gathering of familiar faces.\n\nHis evenly-toned voice was lit with envy as he recalled the numerous paragliding events where he would always find himself under the grand shadow of the deceased Travis. This bitterness was further accentuated by a recent event where Travis triumphed over Everett for a highly acclaimed paragliding award.\n\n\"Do you do much woodworking yourself?\" Winston asked.\n\nEverett's eyes softened, his hands gripped tighter around the intricate carving in his hand. \"Yes, indeed,\" he replied. \"It's the one thing that brings me peace...\"\n\nParallel to the photo of Travis, paragliding expert propelled to international fame, an unsigned artisan found solace in chipping away at blocks of wood, longing for the same acclaim.", "question": "Who is the most likely murderer?", "choices": "['Bryan', 'Everett']", "answer_index": 0, "answer_choice": "Bryan"}, "target": "(`)", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": ["[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please answer the following question with (a), (b), (c), (d) \\n\\nIn the picturesque world of paragliding, hidden secrets tumble as Detective Winston investigates the brutal hatchet murder of Travis, with only Bryan and Everett in the center of the storm.\\n\\nRubbing the backside of his eyes, Winston slowly navigated the case photos scattered across his desk.

Those weren\\u2019t just pranks, he's been doing everything in his power to make a fool out of me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suppose you were near the gliding site before the incident happened?\\\" Bryan nodded, confirming that he indeed was, \\\"Yeah, I was there prepping up the food and drinks we're serving today.\\\"\\n\\nIn the pink-tinged evening light, Winston walked back from the crime scene towards his car. Whispers of unfriendly pranks, public humiliation, and petty thefts filled the air. Across his mind slipped an image of Travis, alone, soaring in the air.\\n\\nDetective Winston sat back in his chair, brows furrowed as he perused the pile of evidence on the sturdy wooden table. He meticulously studied the hapless victim - Travis, a man recently celebrated for his acrobatic skills on a paraglider, a man whose life was cut short at a paragliding site with a hatchet.\\n\\nHis suspect was intriguing, to say the least. Everett he was known as, a bright-faced man whose talent lay in the realm of woodworking methods. Interestingly, a majority of his time was dedicated to curating displays of impeccable craftsmanship at the local woodworking museum.\\n\\nUpon arriving at the museum, Winston took a mental note of the serene aura surrounding Everett. His hands, worn from years of delicate crafting, fondly caressed the various tools in his personal collection. Quiet admiration sparked in his eyes as he studied each piece. The hatchet, which was the murder weapon, had been sourced from this same collection.\\n\\nEverett had a dubious past, considering he had been privy to the office that housed a drawer filled with FFID cards, each bearing a different alias. The coincidental catalog of names was a matching list to Everett's known aliases.\\n\\nIn a room full of bustling conference attendees, Fraser, a local woodworker, casually recollected an incident about an 'Edward' who introduced himself during a conversation at a conference. This character sketch fit Everett impeccably. Yet another time, Winston learned, Everett introduced himself as 'Eric' within a gathering of familiar faces.\\n\\nHis evenly-toned voice was lit with envy as he recalled the numerous paragliding events where he would always find himself under the grand shadow of the deceased Travis. This bitterness was further accentuated by a recent event where Travis triumphed over Everett for a highly acclaimed paragliding award.\\n\\n\\\"Do you do much woodworking yourself?\\\" Winston asked.\\n\\nEverett's eyes softened, his hands gripped tighter around the intricate carving in his hand. \\\"Yes, indeed,\\\" he replied. \\\"It's the one thing that brings me peace...\\\"\\n\\nParallel to the photo of Travis, paragliding expert propelled to international fame, an unsigned artisan found solace in chipping away at blocks of wood, longing for the same acclaim.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Bryan\\n(b) - Everett\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(a) - Bryan"]], "filtered_resps": ["(a)"], "doc_hash": "627b1d64297b0dbf4a048280f492e7b8a807149462f915244bbc23809cc06706", "prompt_hash": "9ea284d4e16a0c0203d7f303f7e27e770fc5cc6aebcbb69029f9d3d6e603107d", "target_hash": "e300f251dc09073a9781733cd99758d04a98290157b77fb5c4a986b123900fc6", "exact_match": 0.0}

But nevertheless he walked through the city park, talking with some locals there on their morning strolls. He was investigating the death of a young woman, Bria, found dead—yes, here—in these park grounds days before.\n\nHis steps took him to the park’s community center, a hub that also served as a point of supply for the various camps around the city. The center stored tools such as hatchets for outdoor activities, usually deployed during camping. He made his way to the office of Naomi, an intern there working specifically with these tools. Naomi taught camping skills not only at the center but also at the camps. She taught how to swing a hatchet, how to build a fire, and overall, how to survive in the wilderness.\n\nWinston knocked, and Naomi opened the door. Winston noticed bandages on her hands.\n\n“Hello, Naomi,” Winston said, “I understand that you knew Bria?”\n\n“Yes,” she said, “We knew each other. She… she was very violent towards me.”\n\n“Violent how?”\n\n“She, uhm… she assaulted me. Several times. I reported her violent behavior multiple times to the police. I was even granted a restraining order against her... at least I had…”\n\nThe words hung in the air. “I was even hospitalized once because of her. All the time, I felt jeopardized by her continuous attacks” \n\n“And Bria, she was here the day she was murdered?”\n\n“I was told she was planning to be here that day, yes. On the same day, I was leading an outdoor skills class. And it was indeed a strange coincidence, I was teaching people how to use a hatchet for chopping wood.”\n\n“A coincidence,” Winston repeated, looking at the bandages on Naomi’s hands again. Then, without a word more, Winston turned and left. He had more people to talk to, and more questions to ask.\n\nWinston flicked his cigarette lighter close, producing a small gust of smoke. The case was still in its initial stages, but he had already pieced together some revealing tidbits. He scrawled on the desk all he knew about a woman named Serenity - the prime suspect.\n\nHe'd first heard about her from a group who camped locally. It was their regular outing spot, they'd told him. \"Serenity is always with us.. always got her hatchet in tow. We've seen her use it - she knows what she's doing,\" they'd mentioned while sharing tales of their outings.\n\nWinston had kept the group to the side and decided to pay a visit to Serenity's home. As he'd approached her home, he'd noticed something unusual about her - her fascination with bugs. Every room was filled with display cases containing various insects, some of them rarely seen in their town. He'd even observed several of those he recognized to be rare and expensive. From what he could see, she had made significant investments to procure and preserve her insect collection, hinting at her large expenses in preserving the rare insects.\n\nHer routine was also centered around these creatures. Apparently, she frequented the library often, particularly the entomology section. In fact, the library's records showed that she had checked out several books on insects.\n\nWhat added to all this was a piece of evidence that Winston couldn't shake off - a letter from the victim. It had been addressed to Serenity, with Bria explicitly mentioning her intentions to testify. The letter revealed Bria's possession of damaging information regarding Serenity's singular, and highly illegal, practices in insect collection and preservation.\n\nAs he visited the library for some more information, a clerk had passed him an interesting insight. \"That girl Serenity? Always in the insect section – with her hatchet, too. Sharpens it while reading, she does.\"\n\nWinston returned to his table with his thoughts. As he flipped through the pages of notes, he came upon a second revelation about Serenity's newfound predicament. After corroborating with several of Bria's friends, Winston learned that Bria had confided in them about her decision to testify against Serenity. The information Bria had was extremely serious, which could lead to dire consequences for Serenity.\n\nStrengthening his suspicion was one piece of evidence echoing in his mind – a hatchet, freshly used and confiscated from Serenity that eerily matched the deadly weapon at the crime scene. Forensic reports confirmed that the blood and ridges of the hatchet were an exact match to the murder weapon at park, tightening his grip on Serenity. Winston could see the connecting dots, but the fear of jumping to conclusions had his caution wobbling on a thin thread.\n\nThe day may have ended, but the case had only just begun.", "question": "Who is the most likely murderer?", "choices": "['Serenity', 'Naomi']", "answer_index": 1, "answer_choice": "Naomi"}, "target": "(a)", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": ["[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please answer the following question with (a), (b), (c), (d) \\n\\nIn the quiet tranquility of the city park, Bria's life was abruptly ended with a hatchet, leaving Detective Winston with two prime suspects - Serenity and Naomi.\\n\\nWinston never loved parks, even when he was a kid.

She\\u2026 she was very violent towards me.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cViolent how?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cShe, uhm\\u2026 she assaulted me. Several times.

I was even granted a restraining order against her... at least I had\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\nThe words hung in the air. \\u201cI was even hospitalized once because of her. All the time, I felt jeopardized by her continuous attacks\\u201d \\n\\n\\u201cAnd Bria, she was here the day she was murdered?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI was told she was planning to be here that day, yes. On the same day, I was leading an outdoor skills class. And it was indeed a strange coincidence, I was teaching people how to use a hatchet for chopping wood.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cA coincidence,\\u201d Winston repeated, looking at the bandages on Naomi\\u2019s hands again. Then, without a word more, Winston turned and left. He had more people to talk to, and more questions to ask.\\n\\nWinston flicked his cigarette lighter close, producing a small gust of smoke. The case was still in its initial stages, but he had already pieced together some revealing tidbits. He scrawled on the desk all he knew about a woman named Serenity - the prime suspect.\\n\\nHe'd first heard about her from a group who camped locally. It was their regular outing spot, they'd told him. \\\"Serenity is always with us.. always got her hatchet in tow. We've seen her use it - she knows what she's doing,\\\" they'd mentioned while sharing tales of their outings.\\n\\nWinston had kept the group to the side and decided to pay a visit to Serenity's home. As he'd approached her home, he'd noticed something unusual about her - her fascination with bugs. Every room was filled with display cases containing various insects, some of them rarely seen in their town. He'd even observed several of those he recognized to be rare and expensive. From what he could see, she had made significant investments to procure and preserve her insect collection, hinting at her large expenses in preserving the rare insects.\\n\\nHer routine was also centered around these creatures. Apparently, she frequented the library often, particularly the entomology section. In fact, the library's records showed that she had checked out several books on insects.\\n\\nWhat added to all this was a piece of evidence that Winston couldn't shake off - a letter from the victim. It had been addressed to Serenity, with Bria explicitly mentioning her intentions to testify. The letter revealed Bria's possession of damaging information regarding Serenity's singular, and highly illegal, practices in insect collection and preservation.\\n\\nAs he visited the library for some more information, a clerk had passed him an interesting insight. \\\"That girl Serenity? Always in the insect section \\u2013 with her hatchet, too. Sharpens it while reading, she does.\\\"\\n\\nWinston returned to his table with his thoughts. As he flipped through the pages of notes, he came upon a second revelation about Serenity's newfound predicament. After corroborating with several of Bria's friends, Winston learned that Bria had confided in them about her decision to testify against Serenity. The information Bria had was extremely serious, which could lead to dire consequences for Serenity.\\n\\nStrengthening his suspicion was one piece of evidence echoing in his mind \\u2013 a hatchet, freshly used and confiscated from Serenity that eerily matched the deadly weapon at the crime scene. Forensic reports confirmed that the blood and ridges of the hatchet were an exact match to the murder weapon at park, tightening his grip on Serenity. Winston could see the connecting dots, but the fear of jumping to conclusions had his caution wobbling on a thin thread.\\n\\nThe day may have ended, but the case had only just begun.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Serenity\\n(b) - Naomi\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(a) - Serenity"]], "filtered_resps": ["(a)"], "doc_hash": "ab11a042dd1b801df5333e298d04b95c581ea98fef737c09afae706a5688c935", "prompt_hash": "94c946d2ddcbc4f92de2b467e5ce3ff6f2397c890dd95909f4490bf401657d9f", "target_hash": "f89bf797c3b1dda4ee48380783e5e979067686a6a9540c5a40e8d75ae5f3d199", "exact_match": 1.0}

The crime scene images were grim; a body dumped in a swamp, a fatal dose of bleach poisoning seemingly the cause. Poor Ricky still wore the glazed-over look of surprise. The thick morass of the swamp had been the final resting place for a man who, not more than a few hours ago, was alive and bound for a visit to his dentist, Glenn.\n\nWinston put away the photos and dialed Glenn's office. A swift answer came from an exhausted receptionist, barely managing to croak out that the clinic was nearing insolvency. She lamented over her situation, without pay for days, and wondering if she'd be paid at all. Winston could feel something wasn't right. He thanked the receptionist and prepared himself for a visit.\n\nUpon arrival to the clinic, the tools of Glenn's trade laid out on a steel tray caught his eye. Among the collection of dental paraphernalia was a large bottle of bleach, no doubt used for sterilizing his instruments.

A professional known to have chosen forensic odontology as a specialty—a pocket of expertise not many in his field would aspire to occupy.\n\n\"Now that's an intriguing line of work, Glenn,\" Winston remarked.

Nothing like the soft chirping of birds at the break of dawn. I have been birdwatching by, funny enough, the swamp, this very morning.\"\n\nThe detective then revealed a rather puzzling piece of information, he had uncovered during his investigation. \"Ricky was found dead in the very swamp, you were birdwatching today, killed by bleach,\" he stated matter-of-factly.\n\nGlenn looked genuinely shell-shocked; fear slowly seeping into his gaze.

{"doc_id": 164, "doc": {"narrative": "When Letti's lifeless body is found horrifically mutilated by a machete at a secluded mountain cabin, gritty Detective Winston faces a chilling whodunit featuring suspects Delilah and Eddie.\n\nWinston glanced at the brightly lit neon sign. \"Eddie's Oasis,\" it read, casting a dancing reflection in the rain-slicked pavement. He sighed, dipping under the awning and pushing open the heavy door. The dusky light spilling over worn floorboards greeted him, along with the riotous cacophony of live music. Eddie’s talent was known, not just as a musician but also for the dazzling machete tricks he had honed and perfected during numerous camping trips. Eddie had mentioned to Winston in their prior encounters how he relied on the machete for safety during these trips, and in the quiet evenings that followed, he would practice for his performances with it.\n\nHis gaze fell upon the figure of Eddie strumming his guitar on the small stage. The song ended and the crowd went wild with applause. As Eddie bowed, his eyes locked with Winston's. Recognizing the weathered detective, Eddie excused himself from the eager gathering of fans and beckoned him over. \n\n“Detective,” Eddie said, quelling the enthusiasm in his tone. \n\n“Glad to see you can take time away from your practice,” Winston said casually.\n\n\"I've got no other pressing engagements at the moment,\" Eddie replied. \"This studio is away from my home. I like to keep my life separate. With no other roles or tasks, I spend my nights here working on my music and machete art. And when I'm not here, I'm out in the wilderness, camping.\"\n\nWinston moved on. \" I heard from Letti, she’d invited you for a song recording at her isolated mountain cabin, which you're staying at for the duration of the recording.\"\n\nEddie nodded. “Yes, it was a wonderful opportunity. Her mountain cabin is beautifully isolated, which makes it an inspiring place especially when you're used to the solitude of camping.”\n\n\"I heard you're someone who enjoys a robust collection of wildlife taxidermy,\" Winston shifted the topic.\n\nEddie’s face lit up, “Yes, I’ve got a whole room full of specimens at my place, even from endangered species. Interesting how life becomes art with death.”\n\nThe interview was interrupted by a growing chorus of fans demanding another performance. Eddie nodded to Winston, picked up his machete, and slipped away. The very same machete he used during his camping trips for safety, now became a prop in his spectacle. He showed the audience his machete tricks, with cheers accompanying each swift, practiced movement.\n\nWinston withdrew from the place, drowned out by the cheering crowd. He left for the isolation of the night, knowing that his work here wasn't nearly done.\n\nWinston pondered over the details of the case. The victim, Letti, had shared with friends about finding documents that implicated her godmother, Delilah, in illicit activities. She had even voiced her intent to go public, starting with confronting Delilah directly. Witnesses reported the last time anyone saw her, it was when Letti walked right into Delilah's cabin with an unflinching resolve. That forced his hand, leading him straight to Delilah's secluded dwelling.\n\nPerched in a rural area with few other houses for company, the cabin was nestled within a copse of trees. As he approached, he saw Delilah outside. Delilah, who was the sole occupant of the cabin known to neighbours, was regularly seen practising with a machete for security purposes. True to the reports, there she was, swinging the machete with a practiced flair, the sun igniting its path before it landed in the trunk of a tree, vibrating under the force of her strike. Even a novice could tell she was someone who knew her way around a blade.\n\nHaving verified her identity, Winston started his interrogation casually, focusing on her peculiar hobby. The queries were about her familiarity with the machete and how she had become so skilled. Delilah responded, her accent echoing with local tones, \"I've been using a machete since I was a teenager.\" She continued, reliving her past, \"Father taught me. I've won a few of the local competitions, too. Helps living alone out here, one needs to keep sharp.\"\n\nWinston noted down her history with the weapon and the regular practise for security. He then moved on to discuss Letti. \"Did Letti come here often?\" he asked.\n\nShe confirmed, \"Letti did come often, yes. The last time she came was yesterday.\" Her face revealed a shift in emotion, recognising the motive behind Winston's questioning. Being keen, he paid heed but continued to be nonchalant.\n\nHe then prodded about her lifestyle. \"You live all alone out here?\"\n\nWith a nod, Delilah confirmed the solitary lifestyle as she retrieved her machete from the tree. Winston, in the following silence, surveyed the lush woodland around the cabin — offering privacy and seclusion. They marked a stark dichotomy between peace and potential criminal activity within an authoritarian mind like him.\n\nTrying to read any hint of reaction, he brought up Letti's concern. \"Your goddaughter,\" Winston started, \"She was worried about you. She found some documents and directly confronted you about some suspicious activities. She even threatened to make it public.\"\n\nDelilah went rigid, her gaze darting toward the cabin. Her cabin – Letti's statements to her friends made it clear. Winston caught the twitch in her eyes but decided not to press further. His main inquiries were done, and the cloak of night began to envelop the landscape. However, he didn't leave empty-handed. The information gleaned from Delilah filled in gaps of Letti's allegations, driving him closer to the incident's truth on the fateful night.

He sighed, dipping under the awning and pushing open the heavy door. The dusky light spilling over worn floorboards greeted him, along with the riotous cacophony of live music. Eddie\\u2019s talent was known, not just as a musician but also for the dazzling machete tricks he had honed and perfected during numerous camping trips. Eddie had mentioned to Winston in their prior encounters how he relied on the machete for safety during these trips, and in the quiet evenings that followed, he would practice for his performances with it.\\n\\nHis gaze fell upon the figure of Eddie strumming his guitar on the small stage. The song ended and the crowd went wild with applause. As Eddie bowed, his eyes locked with Winston's. Recognizing the weathered detective, Eddie excused himself from the eager gathering of fans and beckoned him over. \\n\\n\\u201cDetective,\\u201d Eddie said, quelling the enthusiasm in his tone. \\n\\n\\u201cGlad to see you can take time away from your practice,\\u201d Winston said casually.\\n\\n\\\"I've got no other pressing engagements at the moment,\\\" Eddie replied. \\\"This studio is away from my home. I like to keep my life separate. With no other roles or tasks, I spend my nights here working on my music and machete art. And when I'm not here, I'm out in the wilderness, camping.\\\"\\n\\nWinston moved on. \\\" I heard from Letti, she\\u2019d invited you for a song recording at her isolated mountain cabin, which you're staying at for the duration of the recording.\\\"\\n\\nEddie nodded. \\u201cYes, it was a wonderful opportunity. Her mountain cabin is beautifully isolated, which makes it an inspiring place especially when you're used to the solitude of camping.\\u201d\\n\\n\\\"I heard you're someone who enjoys a robust collection of wildlife taxidermy,\\\" Winston shifted the topic.\\n\\nEddie\\u2019s face lit up, \\u201cYes, I\\u2019ve got a whole room full of specimens at my place, even from endangered species. Interesting how life becomes art with death.\\u201d\\n\\nThe interview was interrupted by a growing chorus of fans demanding another performance. Eddie nodded to Winston, picked up his machete, and slipped away. The very same machete he used during his camping trips for safety, now became a prop in his spectacle. He showed the audience his machete tricks, with cheers accompanying each swift, practiced movement.\\n\\nWinston withdrew from the place, drowned out by the cheering crowd. He left for the isolation of the night, knowing that his work here wasn't nearly done.\\n\\nWinston pondered over the details of the case. The victim, Letti, had shared with friends about finding documents that implicated her godmother, Delilah, in illicit activities. She had even voiced her intent to go public, starting with confronting Delilah directly.

His latest case involved a peculiar victim, Murray, who was fond of working alone during the twilight hours in his office. The cause of death was a strange one - bleach ingestion.\n\nAfter nightfall, Winston's steps echoed in the office building as he sought out his next interviewee.

My rehearsals always seem to go overtime,” Gloria replied, her voice resounding in the empty practice space. Around her, a set of costumes lined the room, each one carefully cleaned. Gloria had a reputation for maintaining the utmost hygiene in her costumes.\n\nWinston remarked, \"It's unusual to see a dance studio without a security camera. The owners not concerned about break-ins?\"\n\n“Well, they leave matters of security to us...

Given her late-night practices, she had repurposed a portion of the room to serve as her personal living space.\n\nIn her living space, an enormous filing cabinet stood imposingly, filled to the brim with newspaper clippings. Winston could tell she was fond of keeping up with recent events. Also, the sheer size of the cabinet suggested it might be Gloria’s version of a living room.\n\n\"I see you have a large filing cabinet in your living quarters, Gloria.

Just yesterday, in his office.

The stakes high, the loss did not sit well with the team or Chris, as Winston observed from the stern look on the coach's face.

The last match was important, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"More than just a game, wasn’t it Detective?\" Chris's evasive reply wrapped around his rising passion for the job. The loss was more personal, Winston noted.\n\n“You’re here during the day, right?” Winston asked, looking for a confirmation.\n\n“Yes, sir. My coaching matches the office's regular hours,” Chris replied.\n\n“Your duties - it must be more than throwing balls and yelling at players.” It was Winston’s turn to lighten up the mood.\n\n“Funny, Detect. I’m responsible for equipment and supply maintenance. And trust me, yanking up fifty-pound weights and keeping the towels and bottles clean and safe - it ain’t no walk in the park.”\n\n\"Safe?

Have to keep it all clean and safe,\" Chris echoed.\n\nWinston recollected an incident from the past where a young office athlete under Chris's coaching had ingested cleaning fluid, mistaken for water no less, and had an unpleasantly grim hospital visit.

Like using cleaning products perhaps,\\u201d Winston stated, looking right at the supplies Chris kept in his office.\\n\\n\\u201cSure. You never know when something spills. Have to keep it all clean and safe,\\\" Chris echoed.\\n\\nWinston recollected an incident from the past where a young office athlete under Chris's coaching had ingested cleaning fluid, mistaken for water no less, and had an unpleasantly grim hospital visit.

His thoughts lingered on Ana’s abrupt violence.\n\nOfficial reports had solidified that aside from the victim, only one other person had been present that tragic night.

He decided that his next course of action was to pay Troy a visit. He found the man at the local church; brows furrowed and eyes distant, clearly lost in thought. The detective approached slowly, carefully observing the suspect.\n\nTroy looked up, noticing the detective for the first time. “Can I help you, officer?” He asked with an accent Winston could tell came from years spent abroad.\n\n“I believe you can, Troy.” Winston replied, deciding to keep the conversation light. “Must be tough work, serving in war-torn areas.”\n\nTroy shot him a surprised look before relaxing. “It is. But it equips you with skills you never imagined having. Back then, often due to shortage of help, I found myself offering assistance in handling explosives, in case of emergencies.”\n\nWinston made sure to keep his expression neutral; the statement held more weight than Troy probably intended to share. “I understand you were quite involved in the community.”\n\n“Aye, I was. And I hoped to get more involved,” Troy said, a touch of bitterness seeped into his tone, \"Ana was unfortunately not supportive of that.”\n\nDetective Winston made a mental note of this as Troy continued, “She was the head, I guess you can say - the ultimate authority in our community. But I feel like, after all my experiences, I could be of more use.”\n\nThe church bell chimed, indicating the start of the evening prayer. The detective decided it was a good time to bring up the incident. “You were at the field the day Ana was murdered, weren't you?”\n\nTroy paused for a moment before nodding. \"Yes.

As he left the church, he pondered what lay omitted from Troy’s words.\n\nPerhaps it was due to the prophetic dreams Troy spoke about before Winston left or the rumors he’d heard of Troy being seen browsing black-market weaponry on a clandestine site. Neither fact sat well with the detective.\n\nWinston scanned the kaleidoscope of colored splatters that patterned the paintball field where Ana was last seen alive. The eerie feeling of standing on the same field where his friend lost her life was strange. Ana had been lost here among the harmless shots and splashes of color, in the same tragic game where a crime took place. The same game Bethany had registered for - the same game Bethany played with Ana.\n\nBethany, Ana’s best friend, was not only well known in this paintball field but also at the military base where she was regularly on duty. Her job there entailed around-the-clock surveillance of the site, ensuring the safe handling of heavy-duty weapons and explosives, including grenades. Bethany's upbringing in the military honed her toughness and her reputation of handling grenades or any other heavy-duty weapons was well taken in the base.\n\nWinston found Bethany near the edge of the paintball field, casually disassembling her marker. He wasn't the only one ever to talk to her, and he also took notice of the accounts of her fellow staff members about her behavior when personal questions arose. They mentioned that she'd often dart her gaze around nervously, avoiding direct eye contact.\n\n\"Mhmm,\" She said, looking away from him.\n\n\"We heard you were good friends with Ana,\" Winston said, watching as her eyes darted around again. \"You were both registered under the same number, you played the same games together.

The field glistened beneath the afternoon sun as a reminder of what once was the playground of harmless games. Now an eerie reminder of Ana's demise.\n\nSurveying the area, Winston noticed a familiar figure in the distance, the outline of Troy, busy in conversation with a group of locals. Troy had a distinctive air about him, a missionary who traveled the globe. He seemed always ready to pack his bags and head off to the next mission. His relationships, both professional and personal, were as temporary as his mission assignments.\n\n\"Winston!\" Troy called out as he saw the detective approach. He quickly wound up his conversation, ending another flitting relationship, and moved to greet him.\n\n\"We meet again, Winston,\" said Troy. \n\n\"Yes, we do. You move around quite a bit, don't you, Troy?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"Will of the call, I suppose. As you know, the mission assignments don't last for very long. I come and go as the need arises. Just like tonight... I am eager to depart to my new destination.\"\n\nWinston nodded, \"Ana did hold quite a position in this community, didn't she?\"\n\nTroy squirmed a bit, \"Yes, she did hold the ultimate authority around here... and sometimes... it's rather... blocking,\" he disclosed rather uncomfortably.\n\n\"And you have been in war-torn areas as part of your mission work, haven't you?\" continued Winston. \n\n\"Yes. Yes, I have,\" Troy confessed, a shadow of uneasiness crossing over his face, \"I was asked to help deal with some... things,\" Troy paused and then added, \"like explosives.\"\n\nWinston continued to stare at him while he spoke, his words sounding like a confession. Still, he remembered the black market weapons site Troy was spotted browsing. \"Quite a history you have, Troy. From relationships to missions, everything has a short lifespan it seems.\"\n\n\"But surely, you must understand, Winston. My journey is driven by divine visions... dreams... prophetic even,\" Troy countered. \"It's these visions...they've shown me that I’m destined to ascend in the rank, to a position like Ana's.\"\n\nWinston blinked, taken aback. \"You think you deserve Ana's position?\"\n\nTroy nodded confessing, \"Maybe it's audacious of me, but yes, I believe I do.\"\n\nAs Winston got into his car later that night, Troy's words about deserving Ana's position kept ringing in his ears. He grimaced and put the car in drive. It was going to be a long night.\n\nThe day was hot, blistering under the late summer sun. The ominous field, notorious for being not only the town's beloved paintball venue but also the crime scene where Ana had been found, buzzed with the adrenaline-infused excitement of an ongoing paintball match. The air smelled of both fresh earth and the grim history of the location. Detective Winston stood at the edge of the blood-stained playfield, studying the dynamics of the game, where both Bethany and the ill-fated Ana had registered to play.\n\nA young woman with windblown hair and a look of absolute determination on her face charged across the field, a steady rain of paintballs exploding around her. Her name was Bethany, Ana's best friend, and unbeknownst to many, her unrequited lover. Winston had read all about her in the case files.\n\nAs the game ended and the players congregated to chat and catch their breath, Winston approached Bethany. Her eyes were still bright with the adrenaline of the game, but they dimmed slightly when she saw him. \n\n\"Howdy, Miss. I'm Detective Winston. Can I talk with you for a moment?\"\n\nBethany nodded but there was hesitance in it. They retreated from the laughter and the noise, heading towards a grove of trees bordering the field. Once they were far enough to be out of earshot, Bethany rounded on him.\n\n\"You're here about Ana, aren't you?\"\n\nIn her voice, Winston heard the threads of grief, but underneath it all was a tangible hint of obsession. According to her friends, talking about Ana was Bethany's habitual way of coping. Bethany's story was compelling, from her military background to her serving duties at the local base, known for its hefty supply of grenades - a dangerous knowledge she was specifically trained for.\n\n\"Yes, about Ana... It must have been hard for you. I heard you two were close.\" \n\nBethany's face scrunched at that. \"Close? Ana was... she was everything to me. I told her as much. But she... she just saw me as a friend.\" She added the last bit in so softly, Winston had to incline his head to hear.\n\nTrying to divert from the topic, he commented. \"That was a good game you played back there. You and Ana... same team I presume?\"\n\n\"You could say that,\" she replied grinning. \"All of us were here, in the very same game, believing that it's just another fun day. Though Ana was always the one who wanted to win. I even followed her around everywhere to learn how she played.\"\n\nWinston glanced at his watch. The time of the paintball game coincided with the exact time when Ana was found. A chilling coincidence he couldn't ignore.\n\n\"Well, thank you for your time, Bethany. I hope we can chat again soon.\"\n\nAs he turned to leave, Bethany called out one last thing.\n\n\"Detective Winston? We all loved Ana... Some of us more than others.\"\n\nAs Winston walked towards his car, his mind replayed those words over and over again.

Now an eerie reminder of Ana's demise.\\n\\nSurveying the area, Winston noticed a familiar figure in the distance, the outline of Troy, busy in conversation with a group of locals. Troy had a distinctive air about him, a missionary who traveled the globe. He seemed always ready to pack his bags and head off to the next mission. His relationships, both professional and personal, were as temporary as his mission assignments.\\n\\n\\\"Winston!\\\" Troy called out as he saw the detective approach. He quickly wound up his conversation, ending another flitting relationship, and moved to greet him.\\n\\n\\\"We meet again, Winston,\\\" said Troy. \\n\\n\\\"Yes, we do. You move around quite a bit, don't you, Troy?\\\" Winston asked.\\n\\n\\\"Will of the call, I suppose. As you know, the mission assignments don't last for very long. I come and go as the need arises. Just like tonight... I am eager to depart to my new destination.\\\"\\n\\nWinston nodded, \\\"Ana did hold quite a position in this community, didn't she?\\\"\\n\\nTroy squirmed a bit, \\\"Yes, she did hold the ultimate authority around here... and sometimes... it's rather... blocking,\\\" he disclosed rather uncomfortably.\\n\\n\\\"And you have been in war-torn areas as part of your mission work, haven't you?\\\" continued Winston. \\n\\n\\\"Yes. Yes, I have,\\\" Troy confessed, a shadow of uneasiness crossing over his face, \\\"I was asked to help deal with some... things,\\\" Troy paused and then added, \\\"like explosives.\\\"\\n\\nWinston continued to stare at him while he spoke, his words sounding like a confession. Still, he remembered the black market weapons site Troy was spotted browsing. \\\"Quite a history you have, Troy. From relationships to missions, everything has a short lifespan it seems.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But surely, you must understand, Winston. My journey is driven by divine visions... dreams... prophetic even,\\\" Troy countered. \\\"It's these visions...they've shown me that I\\u2019m destined to ascend in the rank, to a position like Ana's.\\\"\\n\\nWinston blinked, taken aback. \\\"You think you deserve Ana's position?\\\"\\n\\nTroy nodded confessing, \\\"Maybe it's audacious of me, but yes, I believe I do.\\\"\\n\\nAs Winston got into his car later that night, Troy's words about deserving Ana's position kept ringing in his ears. He grimaced and put the car in drive. It was going to be a long night.\\n\\nThe day was hot, blistering under the late summer sun. The ominous field, notorious for being not only the town's beloved paintball venue but also the crime scene where Ana had been found, buzzed with the adrenaline-infused excitement of an ongoing paintball match. The air smelled of both fresh earth and the grim history of the location. Detective Winston stood at the edge of the blood-stained playfield, studying the dynamics of the game, where both Bethany and the ill-fated Ana had registered to play.\\n\\nA young woman with windblown hair and a look of absolute determination on her face charged across the field, a steady rain of paintballs exploding around her. Her name was Bethany, Ana's best friend, and unbeknownst to many, her unrequited lover. Winston had read all about her in the case files.\\n\\nAs the game ended and the players congregated to chat and catch their breath, Winston approached Bethany. Her eyes were still bright with the adrenaline of the game, but they dimmed slightly when she saw him. \\n\\n\\\"Howdy, Miss. I'm Detective Winston. Can I talk with you for a moment?\\\"\\n\\nBethany nodded but there was hesitance in it. They retreated from the laughter and the noise, heading towards a grove of trees bordering the field. Once they were far enough to be out of earshot, Bethany rounded on him.\\n\\n\\\"You're here about Ana, aren't you?\\\"\\n\\nIn her voice, Winston heard the threads of grief, but underneath it all was a tangible hint of obsession. According to her friends, talking about Ana was Bethany's habitual way of coping. Bethany's story was compelling, from her military background to her serving duties at the local base, known for its hefty supply of grenades - a dangerous knowledge she was specifically trained for.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, about Ana... It must have been hard for you. I heard you two were close.\\\" \\n\\nBethany's face scrunched at that. \\\"Close? Ana was... she was everything to me. I told her as much. But she... she just saw me as a friend.\\\" She added the last bit in so softly, Winston had to incline his head to hear.\\n\\nTrying to divert from the topic, he commented. \\\"That was a good game you played back there. You and Ana... same team I presume?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You could say that,\\\" she replied grinning. \\\"All of us were here, in the very same game, believing that it's just another fun day. Though Ana was always the one who wanted to win. I even followed her around everywhere to learn how she played.\\\"\\n\\nWinston glanced at his watch. The time of the paintball game coincided with the exact time when Ana was found. A chilling coincidence he couldn't ignore.\\n\\n\\\"Well, thank you for your time, Bethany. I hope we can chat again soon.\\\"\\n\\nAs he turned to leave, Bethany called out one last thing.\\n\\n\\\"Detective Winston? We all loved Ana... Some of us more than others.\\\"\\n\\nAs Winston walked towards his car, his mind replayed those words over and over again.

He was headed towards the city's harbor, lost in the stories that swirled around Hailey, an employee on one of the many fishing vessels and a known member of a local gang.\n\nA few moments later he found himself standing on the waterlogged wooden deck of a fishing vessel, amid the smell of fresh salt air and drying fish guts. His eyes were drawn to Hailey, who stood out from the rest of the crew. A young woman in an industry largely dominated by men. She was hauling heavy sacks of fishing lines with ease, her above-average strength clear. As she deftly tied the ends of the ropes into complex knots, her knowledge and skill were evident.\n\n\"Hailey, isn't it?\" He called out to her.\n\nTurning towards him, her sleeve momentarily pulled up, revealing a bold gang tattoo. \"That's what they call me,\" she barked back.\n\nShe was known amongst her 'family' as 'sister', Winston remembered. There was talk of knots and ropes, and the way she skillfully maneuvered them, a testament to her knowledge and experience. The strong bond she held with her gang was clear. But, her love for her 'family' wasn't just talk. Her fierce effort to maintain her gang's reputation was evident.\n\nSuddenly Winston’s cell buzzed in his pocket. His attention shifted to the illuminated screen. It was Derek's social media page. A devout Jew, and a controversial figure due to his blatant disrespect towards Hailey’s gang in his public speeches. Derek's life was an open book - his synagogue schedule, insightful thoughts, and opinions all laid bare on his public profile. Hailey, among countless others, followed him closely on social media channels.\n\n\"Your ship has harpoon, doesn't it?” Winston attempted to change the subject, pointing towards a gleaming pile of equipment on the far side of the deck.\n\n\"All the vessels here have them,\" Hailey answered, dropping her carefree façade for a moment.\n\nWinston made his way back to the mainland, the image of the striking young woman on the fishing vessel etched in his mind, and the echo of a Jewish hymn from a nearby synagogue resonating in his ears. That synagogue, regularly attended by devout Jews like Derek, seemed oddly serene in the surreal evening glow.\n\nHis job was to compile evidence, not to form conclusions.

He was about to meet with Angela, a respected member of the local Jewish community and, somewhat surprisingly, a grandmother who had briefly been to jail. Her physical assaulting of a school bully, who she had been seen confronting, had certainly caused a stir in the neighborhood.

From his pocket, he produced a key, a symbol given only to trusted members of the synagogue, such as Angela, and stepped inside the grand synagogue.  \n\n\"Detective Winston,\" she said extending a hand as he entered, the worry lines on her face making her warm smile all the more prominent.\n\nAfter walking through various hallways, Winston used his trusted member key to access a small, private room where Angela led him. Angela started at once, without any prelude, \"Detective Winston, you must know... Derek confronted me accusing me of betraying him, and told me he was going to tell everyone.\"\n\nAh, the betrayal. Winston had been briefed on this.

His stone-set face showed no emotions as he shuffled through the pictures of Derek ladled onto the cold marble splashed with ink and blood.\n\nHis eyes narrowed slightly as he picked up a photo of what could only be a harpoon. Blinking slowly in contemplation, Winston accepted this as a clue, however strange, and pocketed the photo.\n\nHe pulled out another, a picture of a gang tattoo, and subsequently made his way towards his next suspect.\n\nArriving at the edge of the harbor, he could smell the salty breeze that carried a strong odor of fish and seaweed. Loosely tethered to the slippery wooden dock with expertly tied knots, the sign of someone familiar with ropes, the fishing vessel stood tall and forbidding, bristling with equipment that included several harpoons. He saw the figure of a woman hauling baskets of fresh catch onto the quayside. Her muscles flexed under the strain, but she moved easily and without breaking a sweat.\n\n\"Hailey?\" Winston questioned, the name hanging heavy in the air between them.\n\n\"That's me,\" she replied, shooting him a glance, but continuing with her task.\n\n\"I see your job keeps you in shape,\" Winston stated, noting her above-average strength with a subconscious nod.\n\nIn response, Hailey shrugged, \"It pays, and the work isn't half bad.\"\n\nHailey radiated an aura of authority. This was her world, she belonged here and the others respected her. One of her coworkers passed by, tipping his head in acknowledgement towards Hailey, \"Evening, sister,\" he greeted. \n\nWinston noticed the respect she commanded. He also noticed the way her colleagues avoided looking at her—or rather, the tattoo inked to her arm. \n\nBefore Winston could enquire further, a family passed by them. A group of kids laughing and shoving at each other, a remote jammed into the hands of Hailey as they settled onto a nearby couch.\n\n\"Movie night?\" Winston asked and received an affirmative nod from her. \"Yeah and nobody likes the movies I pick but it's my house so it's my rules.\"\n\nIntrigued, Winston glanced at the television. His eyebrows raised slightly as he noted the opening scene of a classic crime thriller.\n\n\"They don’t usually complain when they don't have the remote though, do they?\" he asked, pointing towards the small device.\n\nHailey smirked, a recognition sparking in her eyes, \"Nah. They know better than that.\"\n\nAmidst all this, Winston noticed a book beneath the coffee table as he turned to leave. Taking a closer look before departing the apartment, he realized it was \"The Psychology of Criminal Minds\", a book known for its study on famous serial killers. \n\nNoticing his focus on the book, Hailey nonchalantly yawned, indicating a late-night reading habit and added, \"Gets me through the night when I can't sleep. Weird preference for late-night read?\" She shrugged as if it were nothing, the faintest spark of defiance reflecting in her steely eyes.\n\nBefore Winston could get a word in, a fellow gang member approached Hailey, muttering something about Derek’s latest public speech disrespecting their gang. Her face stiffened. \n\n\"We'll deal with it,\" Hailey said, her voice tightening, her demeanor shifting. She glanced briefly at Winston, quickly reading his inquisitive expression, and added, \"It's not good to let people trash talk your family.\"\n\nWith that, she sent Winston on his way, staying behind to discuss amongst her 'family' the disrespect Derek had shown towards them.\n\nAs Winston loaded up into his car, his thoughts traveled to her book and her expertise with rope ties. The knots were made by someone who knew their way around a rope, and her job on the fishing vessel could’ve easily taught her that.\n\nWith that, Winston drove off into the evening, the crime scene photos shuffling on the passenger seat.\n\nWinston found himself entering the grand synagogue.

The murder of Derek had sent shockwaves through the community, threatening to disrupt the tranquility of the sacred space.\n\nStanding under the magnificent dome, Winston noticed Angela, Derek's grandmother who was a highly respected member of the community. She was absorbed in polishing a large silver key - clearly bestowed only to trusted insiders of the community.

I am here about Derek,\" Winston delicately approached the subject.\n\nEven though her face remained neutral, the flinch in her eyes revealed her disturbance. \"That's quite alright, detective...\" she started, her grip tight around the key.\n\nWinston caught sight of her unusually strong hands and robust arms – strange for an elderly woman in her society. Upon asking, he discovered Angela has been an avid fisherwoman since she was a child and had won many titles at local fishing competitions. Her robustness was plausibly from her fishing background.\n\nDespite her attempt to evade pressing questions, Angela seemed uncomfortable and hastily brought the conversation to her past and future challenges in the fishing competitions with Derek. Her anxiety seemed tied to the challenges Derek brought forward and the atmosphere would tense every time Derek's challenge escalated. Derek really got to Angela, making her feel threatened and pushed at her limits in these competitions.\n\n\"I remember Derek grinning over that photo; where he caught you secretly betting against him in the last competition,\" Winston probed. \"He told me he intended to expose you at the upcoming one.\"\n\nAngela's reaction suggested his words hit a nerve, \"You see, Detective...

{"doc_id": 174, "doc": {"narrative": "In the sprawling vineyards of Napa Valley, where grapes for the finest wines are nurtured, the bitter taste of murder lingers as Detective Winston investigates the acid-killed corpse of wealthy vineyard owner Henry, with only the enigmatic Ruben and Michael as his prime suspects.\n\nDetective Winston was a man with a knack for solving complex crimes. Currently, he was on a murder case - the victim being a gentleman named Henry. Winston had recently discovered that Henry was murdered in a vineyard using a vial of acid. Intriguing, he thought to himself.\n\nWinston's first stop was a the local flower shop, which surprisingly had a distinct smell of chemicals mingled with the floral aroma. Here, he met the florist, Ruben. It was widely known that Ruben was the only florist Henry trusted for his vineyard.\n\nOn interacting with Ruben, Winston learned that Ruben supplied flowers to the vineyard and that Henry had indeed placed an order on the day of his murder. Ruben had an array of corrosive chemicals at his shop, which he claimed to use in his florist work, including various acids. Moreover, when asked about these, Ruben mentioned he studied Chemistry in University.\n\n\"In fact,\" Ruben added, \"I even use acetic acid regularly for the flower arrangement.\" This aroused Winston's suspicion but kept his thoughts to himself. Soon after, the vineyard's manager confirmed Ruben's presence at vineyard in the afternoon on the day of the murder. Winston headed back to the station, his mind filled with questions.\n\nLater in the day, Winston met with Ruben's niece. She had been visibly upset lately. He remembered hearing a report about Henry engaging in inappropriate behavior with her. He noted she hesitated a bit, but then revealed how Henry sent her threatening messages.\n\nAfter learning everything from Ruben's niece, Winston decided to pay Ruben another visit. When Winston mentioned Henry's improper actions towards his niece, Ruben's demeanor changed. He reluctantly revealed he'd confronted Henry about it before.\n\n\"His words were like poison, make no mistake,\" said Ruben, his gaze was faraway and filled with regret.\n\nWinston nodded, \"Indeed they were\", he remarked, leaving the shop with more questions than answers. All he had were the facts, and slowly he was starting to see the bigger picture - but he knew better than to jump to conclusions himself.\n\nDetective Winston ran a hand over his stubbled chin as he studied the photos before him. The vineyard where they'd found Henry was usually a place of peace and tranquility, gilded in gold rays of afternoon sun and playing host to the chirps of the birds and the hum of the insects. But something horrible had happened here, and the scene’s cheer was forever stained.\n\nFirst on his list was an archaeologist by the name of Michael. The man had a history with the victim and was known around circles for his reckless behavior. Notably, illegal drug use. Recalling the empty vials found at the crime scene and remembering the rumors of Michael often seen under the influence of some substance at work or home, Winston eyed the crime scene images one more time before tucking them away and heading for his cruiser.\n\nEntering the archaeologist's house was akin to stepping into the pages of an endangered species book. A taxidermied animal posed in the corner of every room, the savage beauty of nature juxtaposed against mundane household decor. Winston frowned at the animals. One thing was clear. Michael took pride in his collection.\n\n\"I see you appreciate the decor, Detective,\" came Michael’s voice from the entryway. He was clutching a book to his chest as he stepped into the room. Winston promptly identified the book as the same endangered species directory he'd seen in the crime scene photos. Thumbed pages marked which animals in his collection were endangered.\n\nEngaging in conversation, Winston unearthed more about Michael's profession. Specifically, he learned about Michael's specialized training in handling and disposing of dangerous substances, particularly acid, which was used for cleaning artifacts. It wasn't surprising then, when Michael admitted that he had misused the acid at his workplace a few times and even taken some home for personal use.\n\nHowever, when it came to intoxicating substances, acid was not the only one Michael dabbled in. The archaeologist had been caught using heroin numerous times, appearing to be in a constant state of high intoxication. Winston pitied the man when he admitted it himself, though present sobriety and the bragging tone suggested no remorse.\n\nBefore Winston could turn the topic to Henry, Michael dropped a bomb of his own. He was aware that Henry knew about his drug problem and even offered to expose it. The news didn't faze Winston.\n\nAs he was leaving, Winston cast another round of looks at the quiet occupants of the corners. Michael followed his gaze and nodded in confirmation once more: they were all part of his personal collection. Not pets, not symbols of studied fauna, but trophy displays of a man who kept too many secrets. The detective's job was to unravel them and bring the truth to light.\n\nAs the front door closed behind him, Winston took a moment to watch the house from his car, the conversation replaying in his head.

He remembered hearing a report about Henry engaging in inappropriate behavior with her. He noted she hesitated a bit, but then revealed how Henry sent her threatening messages.\\n\\nAfter learning everything from Ruben's niece, Winston decided to pay Ruben another visit. When Winston mentioned Henry's improper actions towards his niece, Ruben's demeanor changed. He reluctantly revealed he'd confronted Henry about it before.\\n\\n\\\"His words were like poison, make no mistake,\\\" said Ruben, his gaze was faraway and filled with regret.\\n\\nWinston nodded, \\\"Indeed they were\\\", he remarked, leaving the shop with more questions than answers. All he had were the facts, and slowly he was starting to see the bigger picture - but he knew better than to jump to conclusions himself.\\n\\nDetective Winston ran a hand over his stubbled chin as he studied the photos before him. The vineyard where they'd found Henry was usually a place of peace and tranquility, gilded in gold rays of afternoon sun and playing host to the chirps of the birds and the hum of the insects. But something horrible had happened here, and the scene\\u2019s cheer was forever stained.\\n\\nFirst on his list was an archaeologist by the name of Michael. The man had a history with the victim and was known around circles for his reckless behavior. Notably, illegal drug use. Recalling the empty vials found at the crime scene and remembering the rumors of Michael often seen under the influence of some substance at work or home, Winston eyed the crime scene images one more time before tucking them away and heading for his cruiser.\\n\\nEntering the archaeologist's house was akin to stepping into the pages of an endangered species book. A taxidermied animal posed in the corner of every room, the savage beauty of nature juxtaposed against mundane household decor. Winston frowned at the animals. One thing was clear. Michael took pride in his collection.\\n\\n\\\"I see you appreciate the decor, Detective,\\\" came Michael\\u2019s voice from the entryway. He was clutching a book to his chest as he stepped into the room. Winston promptly identified the book as the same endangered species directory he'd seen in the crime scene photos. Thumbed pages marked which animals in his collection were endangered.\\n\\nEngaging in conversation, Winston unearthed more about Michael's profession. Specifically, he learned about Michael's specialized training in handling and disposing of dangerous substances, particularly acid, which was used for cleaning artifacts. It wasn't surprising then, when Michael admitted that he had misused the acid at his workplace a few times and even taken some home for personal use.\\n\\nHowever, when it came to intoxicating substances, acid was not the only one Michael dabbled in. The archaeologist had been caught using heroin numerous times, appearing to be in a constant state of high intoxication. Winston pitied the man when he admitted it himself, though present sobriety and the bragging tone suggested no remorse.\\n\\nBefore Winston could turn the topic to Henry, Michael dropped a bomb of his own. He was aware that Henry knew about his drug problem and even offered to expose it. The news didn't faze Winston.\\n\\nAs he was leaving, Winston cast another round of looks at the quiet occupants of the corners. Michael followed his gaze and nodded in confirmation once more: they were all part of his personal collection. Not pets, not symbols of studied fauna, but trophy displays of a man who kept too many secrets. The detective's job was to unravel them and bring the truth to light.\\n\\nAs the front door closed behind him, Winston took a moment to watch the house from his car, the conversation replaying in his head. He had more research to do. The job was far from over. The job was far from over.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Ruben\\n(b) - Michael\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(a) - Ruben"]], "filtered_resps": ["(a)"], "doc_hash": "ff6db3da3db95079134f5ddb1a00e468524c265e6707c0351223ed1bdd1b3d9c", "prompt_hash": "a96ed352d66971b8d265466d0bdcb243cb5982077c4a2525cf3a0accc3bd26ad", "target_hash": "e300f251dc09073a9781733cd99758d04a98290157b77fb5c4a986b123900fc6", "exact_match": 0.0}

He had been working in his office all day in hopes of getting the dossiers in line for the odd murder by shotgun of Frances. His first hot lead was Meredith, a pet groomer in the heart of the rainforest. It was known that she would often hike through the rainforest for her business, gathering natural products for her grooming services.\n\nAs Winston approached Meredith's shop, it was evident Meredith had an odd passion for the rainforest. The shop was teeming with an assortment of animals, all appearing in need of grooming. She deftly moved from one pet to the other with a rhythm of ease. Her forearm bore a peculiar scar, dome shaped like weasel claws. Multiple scars scattered across her hand made a peculiar sight. When asked about them, Meredith replied, \"I have worked with many pets; they scratch and bite sometimes. As for most of these,\" she waved her scarred hand, \"I really can't remember exactly how I got each one.\"\n\nIntriguingly, Winston could not fail to notice a shotgun that seemed to have made its home in the corner. Noticing how swiftly she hid one of her scars underneath her sleeves, he knew she was a woman who was good at hiding truths. Informed by Meredith's neighbors who had seen a shotgun in her house multiple times, it was clear that she had a tendency to bring it to her pet grooming shop.\n\n“Meredith? I'm detective Winston. May I have a moment?” he asked as he walked towards her.\n\n“Sure detective, how can I help you?” replied Meredith, shooting him a cautious glance. \n\n“It's about Frances. Were you in the rainforest the day she was murdered?” Winston began, watching her closely.\n\n“Yes, I was. I can't avoid the rainforest, detective. That's where I do my hikes and collect the natural products I use for my grooming services,” she said, attempting to hide her uneasiness.\n\nWinston nodded, \"I see. Do you remember where you got that scar that looks like weasel claws?\" he pointed at her forearm.\n\n\"This?\" she rubbed her scar, \"Hmm..., it's hard to remember exactly, but this was from such a long time ago. A ferocious pet weasel mauled me rather badly once. It was quite nasty.\"\n\nWinston's eyes quickly glossed over the assortment of ribbons and trophies that were proudly displayed over the cash register.\n\n\"I see you've won quite a few shooting competitions, Meredith,\" Winston commented, a shadow playing upon his face.\n\n\"Well yes,\" she responded with noticeable discomfort, \"hunting was always more than just a hobby for me. I was a part of a hunting club.\"\n\nJust then, her cell phone rang and she excused herself. His eyes fell upon the shotgun resting against the wall of the shop once again. A moment later, Meredith returned, a steely expression on her face.\n\n“I was near the area Frances was murdered. It is the same path I use for my hikes. I recall it was around the same time,” she admitted. Her voice sounded steady, but Winston could sense the anxious undercurrent.\n\n“Thank you, Meredith. You've been helpful,” Winston nodded, though he had more questions forming in his mind waiting to be queried. There was something unsettling about Meredith's demeanor, her responses almost too guarded and calculated. But only time would reveal the hidden truths.\n\nFlicking away the ashes from his cigarette, Winston sauntered towards the edge of the forest. A path ahead of him led straight to the sight of the day’s tragedy. And just yards away, Frances’ lifeless form laid, crumpled under the towering umbra of the rainforest canopy. As he glanced around, old scents of the forest mingling with a distinct evidence of human presence caught his nose.\n\nPresent at the rainforest on the day of Frances’ murder were two individuals—Frances, the victim herself, and Kinsley, the enigmatic spiritual guru. Kinsley was reportedly seen leading her spiritual group towards the deepest part of the forest earlier that day and later, according to eyewitnesses, she and Frances were alone for a while, disappearing into the thick undergrowth of the rainforest. \n\nWinston wondered about the link between the two women—the one, freshly dead, and the other, a leading figure of a spiritual group already marred by a scandalous past of violent incidents involving firearms. These gun-related incidents had gained such notoriety, that law enforcement had started taking notice of Kinsley's group activities.\n\nKinsley had made no secret of the fact that she kept a shotgun for self-protection, even going as far as teaching the rest of her group the ins and outs of gun use during firearms training sessions. The shotgun retrieved from the murder scene was indeed registered to her, Winston had confirmed as much. Coincidence? He pondered, but quickly dismissed the thought. In his line of work, he didn’t believe in such things.\n\n“Doesn’t mean a thing though…” Winston mumbled to himself, stooping down to inspect the trampled foliage. She might’ve just left it behind in a hurry. But, the existence of the shotgun posed some troubling implications nonetheless.\n\nFrances was more than a random victim, making her murder all the more suspicious. Winston remembered receiving her detailed report, mapping out the unholy nexus between Kinsley's spiritual group, and the local gang. The woman had dedicated herself to bringing down the gang, working closely with local law enforcement to expose their shady deals. Coincidentally, Kinsley had recently gone on record, acknowledging connections between her group and the very same gang.\n\nTo make matters more intriguing, Kinsley's group had chosen to conduct their spiritual meeting in the rainforest on the very same day Frances was killed. Taking a final puff from his cigarette, Winston dropped it onto the ground, crushing it under his shoe. The murder scene was silent apart from the distant hum of wildlife. The twisted calculus of crime was about to unravel, with Kinsley at its epicenter.\n\n“I'll need to talk to Kinsley personally..” Winston voiced his next plan of action.

Walter had been killed, and based on initial investigations, a nail gun was the suspected murder weapon. \n\nWinston set his gaze on the prime suspect...young Dennis. He had been a fixture around the city's construction sites for years, including the ongoing project at the zoo. Not long ago, Winston remembered seeing him at one of the sites brandishing a nail gun, securing beams and panels with confident gestures. \n\nAs he picked apart the crime scene, Winston found a receipt in one of the toolboxes. It was from a hardware store, listing a box of framing nails bought just a day before Walter's murder. \n\nWinston turned his attention to Dennis's background. Dennis feared Walter, who was known to be involved in some shady activities. Walter had tightened a threatening leash on the boy, often bullying him and warning him of severe consequences if Dennis did not follow his orders. Winston also recalled that Dennis had witnessed some of these activities as he was fostered by Walter. \n\nPushing further, Winston discovered that Dennis had been seen at a local hardware store the day before the attack, purchasing exactly the same nails as the ones on the receipt. \n\nDisentangling Dennis's post-work life, Winston uncovered a string of connections entwining Dennis with some dubious faces in town. Dennis was known to frequent 'The Pit,' a bar notorious for the wrong kind of patrons, where he was seen mingling with known gang members. \n\nIn a brief conversation he had with the boy, this grim picture was confirmed. \n\n\"The Pit? Yeah, I go there often. What's the big deal?\" shrugged Dennis, when Winston questioned him about his regular haunt and its denizens. \n\nWinston prodded further, \"Ever see anything out of the ordinary at The Pit, Dennis?\" \n\n\"What do you mean?\" Dennis asked, leaning back on his chair.\n\n\"Anything...unusual. Any fights, perhaps?\" \n\nDennis paused, \"I can hear arguments and fights from my apartment all the time. It's a tough neighborhood.\"\n\nWinston nodded. There had been three assaults reported just last month from that neighborhood - an uncomfortable backdrop to the unfortunate boy's daily life. \n\n\"Stay safe, kid.\" He told Dennis as they ended their conversation. His job, for now, was to dig further into the complex web surrounding Walter's murder.\n\nWinston was in the process of sifting through last month's court documents, ones that had been in Walter's possession. Specifically, Glenn's criminal record stood out among Walter's findings. The record spread over a period of eight years and exposed Glenn's previous stint in the prison.\n\nPromptly the next day, Winston decided to visit Glenn at work. The grocery store was bustling with activity as it was a grocery shopping day for most families in the neighborhood. As Glenn was ringing up a box of high-quality nails, typically used for a nail gun, for a customer, Winston noticed and waited patiently until Glenn got a break from his hectic day to approach him.\n\nGlenn looked surprised to see a customer waiting for him, \"Can I help you with something, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm Detective Winston.\" He showed his badge. \"I have a few questions for you.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Glenn replied hesitantly.\n\n\"Noticed you're in stock with a wide range of nails today,\" Winston pointed towards a packed shelf of nails.\n\n\"Yeah, people need them for all sorts of reasons,\" Glenn chuckled nervously. \"In fact, just purchased some for myself.\"\n\n\"Even for nail guns?\"\n\nGlenn looked a little startled, but quickly composed himself and replied, \"Certainly, sir. But we don't sell the nail guns themselves here.\"\n\nIn the middle of their conversation, a little girl came running up to Glenn excited. \"Daddy, Daddy, I want to go to the zoo again this Saturday!

There were five previous sightings of a man at the local zoo, groceries in hand, and each and every one of them connected to one individual - Glenn. He also found a receipt from the grocery store where Glenn works, it was a purchase for nails specifically for a nail gun.\n\nRemembering a recent eyewitness report of a man on the day of the murder, Winston recalled the description of a man being similar to Glenn, who was spotted carrying a bulky tool bag. \n\nWinston found Glenn at his place of work. Here, he observed Glenn greeting customers by different names, which sent his antenna up. This detail was also mentioned by Glenn's co-workers who noticed the different names on the rota and found it strange.\n\nGlenn, slightly bulky and distractedly stacking shelves, worked in the same grocery store. Curiously, he made a habit of filling out the work schedule with different names each week, a point his coworkers found as peculiar as Winston did.\n\nThe notes also mentioned that Glenn was a troubleshooter. Last winter, instead of hiring a professional, he fixed his leaky roof himself. The nails he bought earlier from the store were for this job, but no nail gun. He had to buy them from elsewhere because the store didn't sell those.\n\n\"Glenn?\" Winston called out, getting the clerk's attention. Glenn turned, his round face projecting innocence.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" He replied, offering Winston a smile.\n\n\"Winston Phillips, homicide,\" he introduced himself, flashing his badge briefly.\n\n\"Has there, uh, been a murder or something?\" Glenn asked, feigning obliviousness.\n\n\"You could say that,\" Winston confirmed, \"Could I ask where you were yesterday, Glenn?\"\n\nGlenn paused, scratching the back of his head before answering, \"Took my little girl to the zoo. We've got a membership there. We always watch the monkeys get fed, it's always at the same time.\"\n\nWinston's eyebrow lifted slightly. This matches the eyewitness reports placing Glenn at the zoo that day, and another reporting a bulky blue bag on his person.\n\n\"A tool bag to the zoo, Glenn?\" Winston raised the question.\n\nGlenn’s smile started to fade, \"I usually carry it around with me for work, it's got all my tools.\" He said, a flicker of unease in his eyes, \"In case I need them, you know.\"\n\nWinston found these elements forming a clear image, but he knew better than to impress suspicion where it wasn't explicitly warranted. He would need more. More conversations, more observations, and more unearthing of Glenn’s peculiar behaviours.\n\nDetective Winston brushed crumbs of his sandwich onto his pile of case files. His latest, involving a man named Walter, was proving rather intriguing. Walter had been involved in some questionable business deals... to put it mildly. An interesting detail in all this was that Walter's murder had occurred during an excursion to the local zoo.\n\nWinston squinted his eyes at the witness statement in front of him, given by the key character in this tragedy, a man named Dennis. Dennis had been living with Walter as a foster son and had been a reluctant observer to Walter's illegal doings. He'd had a fear of Walter that was believable in its intensity. His words stuttered and shook on the page as he described how Walter threatened him with dire consequences.\n\nWinston grabbed his keys and headed out to meet with Dennis at his worksite, the lad worked construction, a fact confirmed by Winston's preliminary check.\n\nApproaching the site, Winston saw Dennis working with a nail gun, a tool that looked like a second skin on the young man's hand. Winston could see the professional ease of Dennis wielding the heavy tool and hit his targets with precision.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Dennis,\" Winston greeted him. The young man paused and turned towards him, his face a flicker of honest surprise. \"Oh, hi, detective\", he replied.\n\n\"Dennis\", Winston started, \"Can you confirm that Walter had invited you to the zoo that day?\"\n\nA chill ran over Dennis's face as he replied, \"Yes, that's correct.\"\n\n\"Do you often go to the zoo?\"\n\nThe young man got a far-off look in his eyes, \"Yeah, we used to go often. Bonding.. they call it..\"\n\n\"I see,\" Winston responded,\" and about your purchase at the hardware store the day before the visit...\"\n\nDennis looked confused, \"Yes, I frequently buy supplies for work. That day, it was a box of nails for my nail gun.\"\n\nLooking around the site party in admiration and part nostalgia, Winston asked, \"Work keeps you busy?\"\n\nGrinning at that, Dennis said, \"It does, detective, but I had a free day... the day Walter died.\" His voice caught on the last sentence.\n\n\"Alright Dennis, thank you for your time\", Winston said, turning on his heel to leave.\n\nThe zoo itself was Winston's next stop. He noted it was unusually quiet and several areas were deserted. Perfect chance for a murder, he mused, not that Dennis did it. There's plenty yet to uncover.\n\nAs he was exiting, Winston's phone buzzed. His latest query results for Dennis had arrived. The lad did visit a hardware store the day before Walter's murder. And the purchase details matched Dennis's account of buying nails for his nail gun.\n\nWinston buckled up in his car and sighed heavily.

Last winter, instead of hiring a professional, he fixed his leaky roof himself. The nails he bought earlier from the store were for this job, but no nail gun. He had to buy them from elsewhere because the store didn't sell those.\\n\\n\\\"Glenn?\\\" Winston called out, getting the clerk's attention. Glenn turned, his round face projecting innocence.\\n\\n\\\"Can I help you?\\\" He replied, offering Winston a smile.\\n\\n\\\"Winston Phillips, homicide,\\\" he introduced himself, flashing his badge briefly.\\n\\n\\\"Has there, uh, been a murder or something?\\\" Glenn asked, feigning obliviousness.\\n\\n\\\"You could say that,\\\" Winston confirmed, \\\"Could I ask where you were yesterday, Glenn?\\\"\\n\\nGlenn paused, scratching the back of his head before answering, \\\"Took my little girl to the zoo. We've got a membership there. We always watch the monkeys get fed, it's always at the same time.\\\"\\n\\nWinston's eyebrow lifted slightly. This matches the eyewitness reports placing Glenn at the zoo that day, and another reporting a bulky blue bag on his person.\\n\\n\\\"A tool bag to the zoo, Glenn?\\\" Winston raised the question.\\n\\nGlenn\\u2019s smile started to fade, \\\"I usually carry it around with me for work, it's got all my tools.\\\" He said, a flicker of unease in his eyes, \\\"In case I need them, you know.\\\"\\n\\nWinston found these elements forming a clear image, but he knew better than to impress suspicion where it wasn't explicitly warranted. He would need more. More conversations, more observations, and more unearthing of Glenn\\u2019s peculiar behaviours.\\n\\nDetective Winston brushed crumbs of his sandwich onto his pile of case files. His latest, involving a man named Walter, was proving rather intriguing. Walter had been involved in some questionable business deals... to put it mildly. An interesting detail in all this was that Walter's murder had occurred during an excursion to the local zoo.\\n\\nWinston squinted his eyes at the witness statement in front of him, given by the key character in this tragedy, a man named Dennis. Dennis had been living with Walter as a foster son and had been a reluctant observer to Walter's illegal doings. He'd had a fear of Walter that was believable in its intensity. His words stuttered and shook on the page as he described how Walter threatened him with dire consequences.\\n\\nWinston grabbed his keys and headed out to meet with Dennis at his worksite, the lad worked construction, a fact confirmed by Winston's preliminary check.\\n\\nApproaching the site, Winston saw Dennis working with a nail gun, a tool that looked like a second skin on the young man's hand. Winston could see the professional ease of Dennis wielding the heavy tool and hit his targets with precision.\\n\\n\\\"Good afternoon, Dennis,\\\" Winston greeted him. The young man paused and turned towards him, his face a flicker of honest surprise. \\\"Oh, hi, detective\\\", he replied.\\n\\n\\\"Dennis\\\", Winston started, \\\"Can you confirm that Walter had invited you to the zoo that day?\\\"\\n\\nA chill ran over Dennis's face as he replied, \\\"Yes, that's correct.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you often go to the zoo?\\\"\\n\\nThe young man got a far-off look in his eyes, \\\"Yeah, we used to go often. Bonding.. they call it..\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I see,\\\" Winston responded,\\\" and about your purchase at the hardware store the day before the visit...\\\"\\n\\nDennis looked confused, \\\"Yes, I frequently buy supplies for work. That day, it was a box of nails for my nail gun.\\\"\\n\\nLooking around the site party in admiration and part nostalgia, Winston asked, \\\"Work keeps you busy?\\\"\\n\\nGrinning at that, Dennis said, \\\"It does, detective, but I had a free day... the day Walter died.\\\" His voice caught on the last sentence.\\n\\n\\\"Alright Dennis, thank you for your time\\\", Winston said, turning on his heel to leave.\\n\\nThe zoo itself was Winston's next stop. He noted it was unusually quiet and several areas were deserted. Perfect chance for a murder, he mused, not that Dennis did it. There's plenty yet to uncover.\\n\\nAs he was exiting, Winston's phone buzzed. His latest query results for Dennis had arrived. The lad did visit a hardware store the day before Walter's murder. And the purchase details matched Dennis's account of buying nails for his nail gun.\\n\\nWinston buckled up in his car and sighed heavily. There was a sense of fear creeping up his spine, not his own but one that belonged to a young construction worker. A troubled foster son. A possible suspect. A probable witness.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Glenn\\n(b) - Dennis\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(a) - Glenn"]], "filtered_resps": ["(a)"], "doc_hash": "955beb6a8b02b4792f6ff12c23128ae4a7f5cc150007fd425a991f71215f5bc4", "prompt_hash": "f66363fc6c8f41a873db525b6832bfc4042fba6a89b32b0a86000d13bd343470", "target_hash": "f89bf797c3b1dda4ee48380783e5e979067686a6a9540c5a40e8d75ae5f3d199", "exact_match": 1.0}

Among the pictures that were scattered in front of him, one was of particular interest. It showed a clear fingerprint, a crucial piece of evidence that was found at the dance studio. This single piece of evidence linked all the mysteries together and led him straight to one person: Homer.\n\nThe body of Nathaniel, a dancer in a quiet town, found at his dance studio had set in motion a chain of events that Winston would not ignore. Nathaniel had discovered Homer's shady financial dealings. Nathaniel had not just shared his dance routine schedule with Homer, but also the explicit bookings of his dance studio times because of their regular appointments. With his strong suspicion, Nathaniel decided to confront Homer about his doubts and had even started to send anonymous letters demanding money as a warning for his misdeeds.\n\nWinston stood up, glanced one more time at the grim photos arrayed on the table, then walked out, his mind set on the person he needed to talk with next: Homer, who had no alibi during the time of the murder and whose fingerprints were on the scene.\n\nHomer was a veteran when it came to numbers. He was both a friend and foe to figures, a financial advisor by trade. Today, he stood in his richly appointed home office filled with trophies, symbols of his past service in the special forces where he was specifically trained in the use of a blowgun. Highlight among these were carefully arranged and meticulously cleaned blowguns-- a recreational activity he enjoyed in his spare time. All signs pointed to Homer acquiring another blowgun recently, adding to his peculiar collection, which he kept in clear view.\n\nTheir conversation started with Winston delivering the hard facts-- the studio bookings that Homer possessed, the anonymous letters traced back to Nathaniel, and the lack of Homer's alibi. Then transitioning into the more circumstantial-- the suspicious activities at strange hours and Homer's history in the special forces, and finally, the gruesome reveal of Nathaniel's murder.\n\n\"You haven't been having an easy time, have you?\" He pointed to the letters, then asked, \"Those threats...those payments? They're from Nathaniel, aren't they?”\n\nBuilding up the pressure further, Winston bluntly asked, \"I suppose you were practicing with your newly purchased blowgun during the time of Nathaniel's murder?\"\n\n\"Well yes, Detective, I was. Just a few days ago,\" Homer confessed, beginning to look nervous.\n\nThe story ended with Winston stepping out into the bright afternoon, his mind full of vital clues and connected dots, leaving Homer amidst the shadows of his room.\n\nWinston slumped in the chair of the dance studio's private box, glancing down at the floor below. Nathaniel's body was still outlined in chalk, a grim reminder of the night's gruesome proceedings. He'd been conducting a standard interview with Clara, the unfortunate woman who'd discovered the body and was last seen near the dance studio shortly before Nathaniel's body was discovered. A tear trailed her cheek as Winston gently asked her the last time she'd seen Nathaniel alive.\n\n\"Shortly before I...found him,\" Clara managed through her poorly disguised sobs. \"Right here in the studio. He was my cousin, you know?\"\n\n\"I know,\" Winston replied softly, nursing his cooling coffee. \"And you're a dancer too, aren't you, Clara?\"\n\nShe wiped the trail of the tear from her face, nodding uneasily. \"Yes, I love dancing. Is it relevant, detective?\"\n\n\"Everything's relevant at this stage,\" he assured her. Clara sighed, delicate fingers playing with the collar of her blouse in a gesture of anxiety. Winston noted the trouble she had staying still, and how she avoided eye contact. \n\n\"And you spend most of your time alone at home, don't you?\" Winston added, following a thought. \n\nClara seemed taken aback at the sudden shift in topic, then nodded slowly. \"Yes I do, between dance practices, I prefer the solace of my room. I seldom go out with friends. It's just not my thing.\"\n\n\"Now, I understand there's been some trouble at home,\" Winston ventured, setting his coffee down. \"Your pearl necklace went missing, didn't it?\"\n\nClara's eyes instantly sharpened, her gaze turning ice cold at the mention of the pearls. \"Yes. I am sure Nathaniel...he stole it.\" \n\n\"That's quite the confirmation, Clara. I remember your reaction when you reported it missing. You were quite distraught, weren't you?\" Winston asked, recalling her visibly upset expression. \n\nClara's eyes reluctantly met his, a flash of anger more evident on her face than tears. \"I confronted him about it the other day! And caught him red-handed wearing my necklace.

I suppose so,\" she admitted with a sniffle, \"Most of my time is spent in the studio. Dancing helps me cope.\"\n\nAnd there was where Nathaniel's body was found, Winston noted.

He was there to have a word with Julius, a Rabbi frequenting the chalet for religious gatherings, who'd been seen at the place not once, but twice on the day of the murder. It was, interestingly, the same day that Julius was seen carrying his sickle for religious rituals at his early morning visit.\n\nThe door of the chalet swung open on creaking hinges to reveal the tall figure of Julius, adorned in his traditional clothing. \"Detective,\" Julius greeted him, the same sickle he had earlier in the day- used specifically in Jewish religious rituals- hung on the wall behind him; a twin to the one that had ended Mackenzie's life.\n\n\"Julius, I'm here to ask you a few questions,\" Winston began, his eyes drifting to the small blade hanging behind the man. Julius nodded in understanding, stepping aside to allow the detective to enter.\n\nThe inside of the chalet was immaculate, all looked as though it was in its appropriate place, nothing before the detective indicated any form of struggle. As they walked deeper into the chalet, Julius spoke to him, \"I was wondering when you'd come around, detective.

I've always admired the company he led, you know.\" Indeed, Winston remembered that Julius had been quite vocal about his admiration for the business. \"Not just the money, the dedication, and even as a part of the ritual ceremonies, I carry the ritualistic sickle admiring the power in the business world it represents for me...\"\n\nWinston nodded as he scribbled down his notes; he was a man of logic and facts, not assumptions. But it did compel him to raise an eyebrow at the information. Mackenzie didn't leave any heirs, and Julius could gain a lot from the man's passing.

All he could do was seek the truth, and let the evidence bring the guilty party to justice.\n\nDetective Winston was surveying the scene of the crime. Mackenzie, a wealthy businessman, had been found dead in his upscale chalet, an apparent victim of a gruesome sickle attack. A witness had mentioned a tour guide named Yolanda, and this had piqued Winston's curiosity.\n\nHe made his way to Yolanda's headquarters just on the outskirts of rural country. The rustic landscape spoke volumes about the kind of territory she worked in. She led tours, predominantly in rustic areas, where heavy duty farming tools weren't out of place.

She was shoveling manure and didn't even break a sweat from the exertion. \n\nHe introduced himself and Yolanda immediately looked on edge. Their conversation was brief and educational. It seemed Yolanda had a penchant for adopting a new persona for every language group she hosted. Winston picked up that she was known as 'Sofia' to Greek groups, 'Isabel' to Spanish ones, and even adopted an Italian name with her Italian clients. With a sly hint of French slipping into her accent, he surmised she likely had a French persona too, although the name was unknown.\n\nAs he chatted with Yolanda, Winston couldn't help but notice a file cabinet, not unlike one found in a law firm, filled with documents. Yolanda caught his gaze and nervously mentioned that these files were a record of past tours she led, including information on the clients.\n\nWinston switched gears and asked Yolanda about Mackenzie. There was a change in her demeanor and she admitted that he had gone on one of her tours. Apparently, during the tour, Mackenzie had found a folder dropped accidentally by Yolanda. This folder had old records, documents and evidence of her dark past full of fraudulent activities and scams against her tour clients.\n\nOn a hunch, Winston decided to pay Mackenzie's lawyer a visit. After a brief chat and revealing his interest in Yolanda, the lawyer handed over a similar folder. Inside were the exact allegations pertaining to Yolanda's past with similar documentation as the folder Mackenzie found. Clearly, Mackenzie had evidence of Yolanda's wrongdoings, and had been threatening to expose her unless she met his demands which seemed to include monetary extortion.\n\nAs he left the lawyer's office, Winston took a moment to lean against his car, lost in thought.

Mackenzie had been part of Yolanda's tour group before his murder occurred on the eve of their scheduled contact. She managed her tours in the countryside meticulously.

This tranquility was disrupted by the gruesome murder of the chalet's owner, Mackenzie. No heirs, all that was left was a cold case just like the winter’s harsh weather.\n\nHis main puzzle piece at the moment was Julius. As far as Winston had gathered, Julius was frequently seen around the chalet courting religious duties. A Rabbi with admiration for Mackenzie's business, he pondered as he moved through the chalet.\n\nBrushing off the snow from his overcoat, he walked down to Julius's residence. He found his neighbour out, tending to his plants, who readily shared with Winston his observations about the Rabbi. “Late nights, buddy, that's when you hear it! Car cleaning noises. Almost ritualistic, you might say.” He gestured with a chuckle towards Julius's car that appeared glistening clean even in the morning frost.\n\nKeeping his poker face intact, Winston thanked him and moved on to Julius's place to gain some firsthand perspective.

Winston studied the eerie photographs of the scene, the brightly lit kitchen contrasted with the grim presence of a crossbow.\n\nShaking his head to focus, Winston remembered his visit to Nicole's home. Her exclusive medieval-themed art pieces took his breath away, as did her pride. \"My treasures,\" she beamed, pointing grandly to a display case which held a pristine medieval crossbow.\n\nA memory tugged at his mind, it wasn't just the crossbow she was proud of. He recalled a discussion with a bartender, the mention of Nicole's frequent appearances at medieval art auctions. What's more, Nicole had been known to read books on crossbows, and there were even whispers among her acquaintances of her crossbow-shooting practices.\n\nAnd then there were the rumors, dark whispers that followed Nicole like a specter. It seemed that almost everyone Nicole had been friendly with had died under mysterious circumstances, the very circumstances that were all too familiar to Winston as he studied the police records. \n\nToo many puzzle pieces, yet somehow connected. Even the seemingly mundane receipt Winston held in his hand felt like a silent hint. Nicole had gone grocery shopping recently and had the forethought to buy the deceased's favorite snacks, her groceries for the day when she'd stayed home, and which now lay untouched on the granite counter.\n\nWinston felt the connection, not clear, yet humming under the surface. What were all these interesting coincidences? Was it pure chance that Nicole collected pieces of art connected to people who lay dead? Or that Wilhelmina, a renowned collector of medieval artifacts including crossbows, was found by a crossbow in her friend's kitchen, a friend who had somehow acquired an authentic crossbow as part of her art collection and stayed home all day?\n\nHe picked up the phone, ordered more coffee, and resumed his investigations. An intricate puzzle indeed.\n\nWinston frowned at the laptop screen in front of him, then squinted. A plethora of eBooks on archery and yoga were being sent to Isabelle's inbox, indicating Isabelle received her reading materials digitally. A picture of the cheery-looking Isabelle, beaming next to a massive crossbow, was plastered all over her heavily used social media accounts. The caption boasted of her skills, \"So proud to be part of the city archery club.\" He navigated to a different tab, confirming her membership of an online archery club that used crossbows.\n\nAs he studied her profile, he noted some details in her bio that surprised him slightly. Next to the information that she was a yoga instructor, it read, \"Travel junkie! Always out exploring after each teaching contract!\" She had also listed her LinkedIn, which Winston opened. He grimaced as he skimmed over her numerous long-term contracts in various cities, and her preferred methods of payment were invariably digital.\n\nDetermined to get a clearer picture of Isabelle, he called her up.\n\n“Isabelle, this is Detective Winston. I’d like to ask you a few questions about the death of Wilhelmina. I’d like to meet in person,” he said.\n\n“I’d prefer if we chat online, Detective. I’m more comfortable that way,” she replied, again indicating her strong preference for online communication.\n\nHours later, on a video call, Isabelle appeared composed but slightly guarded. \n\n\"Routine is central to my yoga classes, Detective,\" Isabelle said, and she further explained that her yoga schedule ran like clockwork. The sessions followed a rigid timeslot and it just so happened that the fateful class in Wilhelmina's kitchen took place right around the time of the murder.\n\n\"Wilhelmina was a regular attendee in my classes, and she even offered her kitchen for one of our sessions. She thought the atmosphere would be more inviting,\" Isabelle shared. She paused, seemingly unsure if she should continue. After a beat, she added, \"She was a sweet lady.

I didn’t do anything wrong.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I just finished up a teaching contract in this city and I look forward to exploring this place more, Detective,\" she concluded, a half-smile playing on her lips.\n\nAfter the call ended, Winston sat back in his chair, taking in the conversation.

Josephine's new lover, the wrathful confrontation with Dale, the police going through Dale's house and coming up with suspicious multiple driver's licenses, Dale's frequent presence at the victim's frequented café, and his predilection to appear wherever Josephine was.\n\nWinston shook his head slightly, trying to dissipish the fog of conclusions starting to form.

She asked you to her place I understand,\" Winston continued.\n\n\"That's true,\" Dale confirmed. \n\nWinston’s cop senses burned, but he showed nothing on his face. \"You were in town on the day she died, weren't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Dale replied, \"I wasn't hiding.\"\n\n\"That makes sense,\" Winston replied. \"According to witnesses, they saw you leaving Josephine's house.\"\n\nDale glanced at him sharply. \"You're the detective. You tell me.\"  \n\nWinston tipped his hat cordially. \"Thank you for your time, Dale.\"\n\nWinston couldn't shake off the unsettled feeling as he looked at the crime scene photos one more time before heading out. But, despite his feelings, he knew he would have to dig deeper to reveal the truth. Only proof would suffice.\n\nWinston sat in his office poring over the case files once again. The victim was a woman named Josephine. She had recently joined the company where the main suspect, Letti worked. Josephine’s home had been blown to smithereens from an explosion while she was inside alone. Letti, an employee who often worked in Josephine’s home as part of her job was spotted in the area around the time of the explosion.\n\nHe rubbed his weary eyes, decision time. He hailed a taxi and headed to the company where Letti worked. The building was abuzz with activity as he walked in. Letti had left for the day, but her manager was more than happy to answer Winston’s questions. \n\n\"Letti? Yeah, she's been with us for a while. Started from scrap and climbed her way up,\" the manager began. \"Her duty to routinely work in Josephine's house due to her job profile indeed proves her dedication. Her engineering degree really gave her an edge, especially with the nitty-gritty of machinery.\"\n\n\"She was looking for a promotion, isn't she?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"You got that right, for a long time actually. A promotion would've helped her with her bills too. I heard she was struggling,\" the manager confessed.\n\n\"Ah, she was seen near Josephine’s house around the time of the explosion?\" Winston carefully watched for any reaction. The manager's surprise seemed genuine.\n\n\"That's odd. But, you know Josephine trusted her. Even gave her a key.\" Winston raised his eyebrow but said nothing, noting his reaction.\n\nThe next day, Winston got the chance to meet Letti for an informal conversation. She was smartly dressed and carried a professional air around her.\n\n\"I heard Josephine had just joined recently but was already being considered for the promotion,\" Winston began.\n\n\"Yes, she was. I must say I was a bit envious of her quick success,\" Letti admitted. \"Anyway, how can I help, detective?\"\n\n\"You work with chemicals daily due to the nature of your work at Josephine's house,\" Winston began. \n\n\"Well, detective, that's true. My role requires me to handle these substances not only at the company but more so when I am working at Josephine's house. Some even have the capacity to create a potent explosive if not handled correctly,\" she admitted looking cautiously at the detective.\n\nAs Winston left the building, he pondered over what he’d learned. Letti’s struggle for a promotion seemed plausible given her financial difficulties and Josephine was a direct threat to her. But would the envy drive her to kill Josephine and blow up her house? Only time would tell.

A promotion would've helped her with her bills too. I heard she was struggling,\\\" the manager confessed.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, she was seen near Josephine\\u2019s house around the time of the explosion?\\\" Winston carefully watched for any reaction. The manager's surprise seemed genuine.\\n\\n\\\"That's odd. But, you know Josephine trusted her. Even gave her a key.\\\" Winston raised his eyebrow but said nothing, noting his reaction.\\n\\nThe next day, Winston got the chance to meet Letti for an informal conversation. She was smartly dressed and carried a professional air around her.\\n\\n\\\"I heard Josephine had just joined recently but was already being considered for the promotion,\\\" Winston began.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, she was. I must say I was a bit envious of her quick success,\\\" Letti admitted. \\\"Anyway, how can I help, detective?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You work with chemicals daily due to the nature of your work at Josephine's house,\\\" Winston began. \\n\\n\\\"Well, detective, that's true. My role requires me to handle these substances not only at the company but more so when I am working at Josephine's house. Some even have the capacity to create a potent explosive if not handled correctly,\\\" she admitted looking cautiously at the detective.\\n\\nAs Winston left the building, he pondered over what he\\u2019d learned. Letti\\u2019s struggle for a promotion seemed plausible given her financial difficulties and Josephine was a direct threat to her. But would the envy drive her to kill Josephine and blow up her house? Only time would tell. His mind went back to the crime scene: Josephine alone, the explosion, Letti in the vicinity, and at her disposal, the lethal mix of chemicals from her daily work at Josephine's home.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Dale\\n(b) - Letti\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(b) - Letti"]], "filtered_resps": ["(b)"], "doc_hash": "1e8fecccc29648535b0e1e921ef18549c6322c0395af87b9e35626ffeccd56e1", "prompt_hash": "e05370664f5c96cb481f82076c0d90686fdfd7c20aa34c99ecec7c76d634fe98", "target_hash": "f89bf797c3b1dda4ee48380783e5e979067686a6a9540c5a40e8d75ae5f3d199", "exact_match": 0.0}

The murder scene was an unsavory juxtaposition of innocence - usually bustling with kids, laughter, and vibrant life, now tainted with the solemnity of demise and the faint smell of bleach lingering in the air. \n\nHis next step was Helen, Mack's sole testamentary beneficiary it seemed, and his housekeeper - a critical point of interest.\n\nArriving at the soccer field, he spotted Helen from afar, scrubbing away at the stubborn grass stains with a generous amount of bleach - a daily routine in her housekeeping duties. She was an efficient worker, with knowledge on various cleaning products and supplies, which her job demanded.\n\nHis eyes became glued to a large quantity of bleach that Helen had with her. An unsettling thought crossed his mind, quickly followed by a dismissive wave. \n\nWinston introduced himself to Helen who was already there. Judging by her demeanor, he got an underlying sense of humiliation boiling within her, perhaps a result of being objectified at her job as a housekeeper. \n\n\"Do you clean up after the games every time?\" Winston asked, breaking the tense silence.\n\n\"Every single time. They don't clean up after themselves, so someone's got to do it,\" Helen said, her tone full of regrettable resignation, showing no signs of withholding information.\n\n\"So, you were here, even when the game was on?\" Winston then asked, the seemingly benign query holding a latent inquiry.\n\n“Yes, and Mr. Mack, bless his soul, stayed behind with me after everyone else had left,” Helen replied, burrowing her frown even further, eyes welling up with unseen tears. \n\nShe continued talking away, inadvertently revealing how she's often at the rough end of some nasty backbiting, making Winston wonder if that might've fuelled her self-diminution.\n\n\"Are you Mack's housekeeper?\" Winston asked, out of the blue, seemingly testing Helen's patience.\n\nShe stared at him for a solid minute before affirming she was, indeed, Mack's housekeeper. Mack, she recalled, even included Helen's role in his will, stating that she should run the house in the event of his untimely demise. \n\nWith an interview like this, it was hard not to observe how it all seemed to add up, but Winston prudently kept his findings to himself.\n\nAs Winston returned to his car, he remembered Mack, a man with no family, found dead right after one such soccer game Helen was apparently cleaning up for. He also remembered an incident involving Helen from the past – an unfortunate mishap where a staff member had accidentally ingested a cleaning supply.\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston muttered to himself, starting his car. \"Very interesting indeed.\"\n\nThis was going to be a long case.\n\nWinston idly flicked through the passport he had received from a fellow officer, who found it thrown aside at the soccer field, where teenagers often conjugated. \"Maria,\" he read aloud from the passport photo. He flipped it over to find another stamp from Denmark and a passport photo stapled to the back – \"Chloe, Denmark.\" Holy hell, what a lead.\n\nTurning his attention to the crime scene, it wasn't long before Detective Winston found himself on the doorstep of Danielle, the local spiritual guru, alternatively known as Maria and Chloe in her past.\n\nDanielle's reputation preceded her not just for her aliases but also for her meticulous cleaning which she considered a spiritual activity. \"It's a form of meditation for me, I find serenity in cleanliness,\" Danielle replied to Winston's gentle ribbing, with a slight smile.\n\n\"Is that why you’re against Mack's wedding?\" Winston asked. She blinked at him. \"Rumor has it, you've taken quite the interest in Mack's so called love-life.\" \n\nDanielle, in her belief of spiritual purity, confessed, \"Harmful karmic consequences often ensue when one person pledges themselves to someone they do not love. Mack was about to please his parents by making such a mistake, marrying a woman he didn't care for. I wanted Mack to remain single, as I believe it would have maintained his spiritual purity.\"\n\nShe paused to siphon some tea from a kettle, her eyes never leaving Winston. \"By the way, Detective, I think you’ve dropped something,\" she said, pointing at the passport Winston had forgotten in his jacket pocket. \"Oh, that?\" he asked nonchalantly, \"It's your passport, isn’t it? Maria, Chloe, all your aliases, found at the crime scene.\"\n\nDanielle gave it a fleeting glance and said, \"Ah I see, Detective. Still, it's not the one I use currently... I don't need a passport to travel. I have lived in many places under many names, including Sophie in France.\"\n\nWinston kicked a stone down the road as he left Danielle's residence, pondering on her confessions. \"Sophie, France\", he mumbled to himself. More identities. More questions. \n\nBack at the station, he poured over the evidence once more which also had multiples items linking Danielle to the alias Sophie in France. Mack was about to wed a woman he didn’t love just to please his parents... and there he lay on the soccer field, with the smell of bleach fresh in his throat.

They don't clean up after themselves, so someone's got to do it,\\\" Helen said, her tone full of regrettable resignation, showing no signs of withholding information.\\n\\n\\\"So, you were here, even when the game was on?\\\" Winston then asked, the seemingly benign query holding a latent inquiry.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, and Mr. Mack, bless his soul, stayed behind with me after everyone else had left,\\u201d Helen replied, burrowing her frown even further, eyes welling up with unseen tears. \\n\\nShe continued talking away, inadvertently revealing how she's often at the rough end of some nasty backbiting, making Winston wonder if that might've fuelled her self-diminution.\\n\\n\\\"Are you Mack's housekeeper?\\\" Winston asked, out of the blue, seemingly testing Helen's patience.\\n\\nShe stared at him for a solid minute before affirming she was, indeed, Mack's housekeeper. Mack, she recalled, even included Helen's role in his will, stating that she should run the house in the event of his untimely demise. \\n\\nWith an interview like this, it was hard not to observe how it all seemed to add up, but Winston prudently kept his findings to himself.\\n\\nAs Winston returned to his car, he remembered Mack, a man with no family, found dead right after one such soccer game Helen was apparently cleaning up for. He also remembered an incident involving Helen from the past \\u2013 an unfortunate mishap where a staff member had accidentally ingested a cleaning supply.\\n\\n\\\"Interesting,\\\" Winston muttered to himself, starting his car. \\\"Very interesting indeed.\\\"\\n\\nThis was going to be a long case.\\n\\nWinston idly flicked through the passport he had received from a fellow officer, who found it thrown aside at the soccer field, where teenagers often conjugated. \\\"Maria,\\\" he read aloud from the passport photo. He flipped it over to find another stamp from Denmark and a passport photo stapled to the back \\u2013 \\\"Chloe, Denmark.\\\" Holy hell, what a lead.\\n\\nTurning his attention to the crime scene, it wasn't long before Detective Winston found himself on the doorstep of Danielle, the local spiritual guru, alternatively known as Maria and Chloe in her past.\\n\\nDanielle's reputation preceded her not just for her aliases but also for her meticulous cleaning which she considered a spiritual activity. \\\"It's a form of meditation for me, I find serenity in cleanliness,\\\" Danielle replied to Winston's gentle ribbing, with a slight smile.\\n\\n\\\"Is that why you\\u2019re against Mack's wedding?\\\" Winston asked. She blinked at him. \\\"Rumor has it, you've taken quite the interest in Mack's so called love-life.\\\" \\n\\nDanielle, in her belief of spiritual purity, confessed, \\\"Harmful karmic consequences often ensue when one person pledges themselves to someone they do not love. Mack was about to please his parents by making such a mistake, marrying a woman he didn't care for. I wanted Mack to remain single, as I believe it would have maintained his spiritual purity.\\\"\\n\\nShe paused to siphon some tea from a kettle, her eyes never leaving Winston. \\\"By the way, Detective, I think you\\u2019ve dropped something,\\\" she said, pointing at the passport Winston had forgotten in his jacket pocket. \\\"Oh, that?\\\" he asked nonchalantly, \\\"It's your passport, isn\\u2019t it? Maria, Chloe, all your aliases, found at the crime scene.\\\"\\n\\nDanielle gave it a fleeting glance and said, \\\"Ah I see, Detective. Still, it's not the one I use currently... I don't need a passport to travel. I have lived in many places under many names, including Sophie in France.\\\"\\n\\nWinston kicked a stone down the road as he left Danielle's residence, pondering on her confessions. \\\"Sophie, France\\\", he mumbled to himself. More identities. More questions. \\n\\nBack at the station, he poured over the evidence once more which also had multiples items linking Danielle to the alias Sophie in France. Mack was about to wed a woman he didn\\u2019t love just to please his parents... and there he lay on the soccer field, with the smell of bleach fresh in his throat. The same bleach that Mack\\u2019s spiritual guru, Maria, Chloe, Sophie, Danielle would stock in volumes almost crazy enough to put a cleaning supply store out of business.\\n\\nWhat a case.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Helen\\n(b) - Danielle\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(b) - Danielle"]], "filtered_resps": ["(b)"], "doc_hash": "15271eceeaecdcf8be239b59ddef432395496ee2abe89cd20866015664cf1fc2", "prompt_hash": "f2ddf8e566314fbf8f84771162ad0a5ef6063f73af8db785a82a4ca124004837", "target_hash": "e300f251dc09073a9781733cd99758d04a98290157b77fb5c4a986b123900fc6", "exact_match": 0.0}
{"doc_id": 191, "doc": {"narrative": "When Mack's life got fatally bleached out on a soccer field, it was up to Detective Winston to sift through the dark clues left by his suspects: Helen and Danielle.\n\nWinston stared at the crime scene in front of him. The soccer field's lush greenery was marred by the gruesome sight of Mack's lifeless body. His bleached face was contorted in an expression of surprise, as though he couldn't believe what had happened.\n\n\"Helen, did you clean up post-game?\" Winston posed his question with a stern expression. The corner of his mouth upturned as he noticed a potential clue, but didn’t let it reach his eyes.\n\n\"Yes, Detective. As I always do,\" Helen replied, her face drawn with somberness. Winston noted her impeccably clean appearance and gloves, without a trace of mud despite the weather and her outdoor responsibilities.\n\nHelen was the housekeeper here. Mack, having no family, had entrusted her with the keys to the house, as mentioned in his will. Winston flipped through his notes, recalling that not only did Helen work for Mack, but she came to the game early that day and was still there after everyone had left, right around the time Mack was found dead.\n\nWinston delved a little deeper. \"I understand that you enjoy camping, Helen...alone?\" \n\n\"Yes, it's my chance to unwind, to hike off trails and be amongst nature. Besides, I enjoy the solitude that these trips offer and prefer not to have any company,\" Helen added, thereby hinting at why she refused to let anyone join her on these outings.\n\n\"I see,\" Winston said. \"And water activities, do you engage in any during these camping trips?\"\n\nTaken aback, Helen never expected such a question. \"Actually, no. I don't fancy spending time near the water, camping is mostly about the solitude for me.\"\n\n\"Hmm, I see.\" Winston made a show of jotting this down in his notebook, his eyes never leaving Helen's face.\n\n\"The people at the house, do they appreciate your work?\" Winston posed his question carefully.\n\n\"I’ve overheard malicious conversations about me and my work.

As more pieces clicked into place, he thanked Helen and excused her, promising to update her further on the case. Winston prided himself on his professionalism. His job was simply to collect clues for an often unforgiving puzzle.\n\nHe couldn't shake the thought of why a housekeeper, like Helen, who strongly avoided mud and water, went camping so frequently, choosing often to go off the beaten trail.

The young man had been on the cusp of marriage, though rumors swirled that the engagement was nothing more than an elaborate ruse to satisfy the expectations of his parents.\n\nWinston sighed deeply and continued to scan the case file. There was something unusual about this crime. The murder weapon of choice, a bottle of bleach, was anything but typical, and the name Danielle, scribbled repeatedly throughout his notes, gave the detective pause.\n\nDanielle - a local spiritual guru known throughout the community for her meticulous cleaning.

He had just finished getting the report from the establishment confirming that only Mia had booked the private dining area the previous night. Emma, an emerging political whiz-kid, had been found dead on the lavish dining table.\n\n\"Mia,\" Winston muttered to himself whilst turning his car's ignition. A well-known politician, she had been married to Emma.\n\nAfter checking his notes, Winston dropped by the shooting range. He'd heard Mia was a regular there. He took a seat in the observation area, watching as Mia effortlessly hit targets at incredible ranges. Word had it, Mia had secured several victory titles in various shooting competitions around the city.\n\nThe shooting range offered more than targeting practice. The place also sold a range of guns and ammunition. As he walked around the range, he noted the various types of ammunition on offer, including a type of ammunition recently purchased by Mia that coincidentally matched the type used in the murder weapon found at the restaurant.\n\nOnce she finished with her practice, Winston approached Mia, asking if they could head to a nearby café to chat. Multiple eyewitness accounts corroborated her presence at the restaurant the night before, so he wanted to get her take on events.\n\nThe pair discussed the city's sights, the weather, but mostly their jobs. Both women were well-known politicians, each with her own challenges. Emma had been gaining public approval for her stance on various political issues, hinting at a bright future in politics. It was widely rumored that Emma planned to unveil a series of scandals surrounding Mia in the coming weeks.\n\nAs they wrapped up their conversation, Winston asked Mia about the private dining area at the restaurant.\n\n“Yes, I had booked it for the evening,\" Mia admitted, \"It was easier to discuss our issues in private. It was only for Emma and I. In fact, I was the only one that had the keys to that area. We used to frequent that place, and I had the keys to ensure privacy whenever we needed it.”\n\nThey were pictured dining together by onlookers earlier that evening, not long before Emma was found dead, Winston thought. The information he'd gathered was piling up. It was time to go back to the station and untangle this web of information. \n\n“Thanks for the catch-up Mia, and the espresso. We’ll be in touch,\" Winston said as he rose from his seat. The mystery of Emma's death was far from over, but every conversation provided another piece of the puzzle.\n\nDetective Winston untwisted the final thread of his woolen wrap, the chilling winter wind sweeping through the luxury restaurant caused the patrons to shiver. Even though the place was filled with the sound of tinkling glassware and soft murmurs, Winston’s thoughts trailed towards Emma...\n\nEmerald-eyed Emma, who recently came into an immense inheritance. Such a windfall was more money than anyone else in their social circle, making her the only one who could financially save Warren from his mounting debts.. Winston swallowed back a bitter taste and turned towards his current predicament, a quiet table in the corner housing a man named Warren.\n\nWarren, Emma's grandfather, a well-known introvert and a man of old-world charm. A hoarder of antiques, he frequently surrounded himself with relics of the past. As Winston caught sight of Warren, he noticed his safety haven of antiques marking a stark contrast in the ultra-modern ambience of the restaurant.

The trove of antiques were a reflection of Warren's keen interest in collectables, drawing Winston towards a long lost era which seemed to be preserved in their presence.\n\n\"Let's get right to it then,\" Warren began, his baritone voice vibrating through the room, making Winston come back to the present. \"You want to know about Emma. About the money, the pistol... my part in it. Well, ask away,\" he said, fingers clasping tightly around a cane with an eagle-headed handle, face etched in grim determination.\n\n\"Mr. Warren, your military background,\" Winston began, gauging the man before him. \"Active combat, so I heard.\"\n\nA pause persisted around them, Warren closing his eyes briefly, as if the memories were debilitating.

Winston took note of the man’s unease during conversations reflecting his introverted nature.\n\n\"Emma's money, it saved you from debt, did it not?\" Winston prodded gently, trying to keep the conversation going despite Warren’s discomfort. The older man let out a soft sigh, his discomfort apparent. \"It was no secret I was neck-deep in debt and Emma was my only salvation,\" he conceded, \"I did seek help from her, but Emma...\" he trailed off, avoiding eye contact. \n\nWinston excused himself, not wanting to push the introverted man farther into his discomfort. As he walked away from Warren, he took one final glance back at the man surrounded by his personal collection of antiques.

He had just finished getting the report from the establishment confirming that only Mia had booked the private dining area the previous night. Emma, an emerging political whiz-kid, had been found dead on the lavish dining table.\\n\\n\\\"Mia,\\\" Winston muttered to himself whilst turning his car's ignition. A well-known politician, she had been married to Emma.\\n\\nAfter checking his notes, Winston dropped by the shooting range. He'd heard Mia was a regular there. He took a seat in the observation area, watching as Mia effortlessly hit targets at incredible ranges. Word had it, Mia had secured several victory titles in various shooting competitions around the city.\\n\\nThe shooting range offered more than targeting practice. The place also sold a range of guns and ammunition. As he walked around the range, he noted the various types of ammunition on offer, including a type of ammunition recently purchased by Mia that coincidentally matched the type used in the murder weapon found at the restaurant.\\n\\nOnce she finished with her practice, Winston approached Mia, asking if they could head to a nearby caf\\u00e9 to chat. Multiple eyewitness accounts corroborated her presence at the restaurant the night before, so he wanted to get her take on events.\\n\\nThe pair discussed the city's sights, the weather, but mostly their jobs. Both women were well-known politicians, each with her own challenges. Emma had been gaining public approval for her stance on various political issues, hinting at a bright future in politics. It was widely rumored that Emma planned to unveil a series of scandals surrounding Mia in the coming weeks.\\n\\nAs they wrapped up their conversation, Winston asked Mia about the private dining area at the restaurant.\\n\\n\\u201cYes, I had booked it for the evening,\\\" Mia admitted, \\\"It was easier to discuss our issues in private. It was only for Emma and I. In fact, I was the only one that had the keys to that area. We used to frequent that place, and I had the keys to ensure privacy whenever we needed it.\\u201d\\n\\nThey were pictured dining together by onlookers earlier that evening, not long before Emma was found dead, Winston thought. The information he'd gathered was piling up. It was time to go back to the station and untangle this web of information. \\n\\n\\u201cThanks for the catch-up Mia, and the espresso. We\\u2019ll be in touch,\\\" Winston said as he rose from his seat. The mystery of Emma's death was far from over, but every conversation provided another piece of the puzzle.\\n\\nDetective Winston untwisted the final thread of his woolen wrap, the chilling winter wind sweeping through the luxury restaurant caused the patrons to shiver. Even though the place was filled with the sound of tinkling glassware and soft murmurs, Winston\\u2019s thoughts trailed towards Emma...\\n\\nEmerald-eyed Emma, who recently came into an immense inheritance. Such a windfall was more money than anyone else in their social circle, making her the only one who could financially save Warren from his mounting debts..

He remembered her as a skilled bartender at a high-end restaurant, famed for her unique way of handling a corkscrew, especially while opening extravagant wine bottles. Recently, she seemed to have been working outside of normal working hours. She was often seen requesting financial support from Frederick, an affluent regular customer who wouldn't mind doling out his means for attention.\n\nA friend once mentioned to him Frederick’s intention to spill the beans about Tessa's grim reality. It was not every day someone aimed to settle a debt of that size, and the situation intrigued Winston. Using the information he had, he traced that Tessa had checked in the motel a couple of days before Frederick’s demise.\n\nWinston pulled his sedan into the dusty lot of the low-rise motel on the outskirts of town. There he saw Tessa, emerging from a room and handing a key back to the motel manager. The motel staff confirmed that the implicating room was indeed paid for by Tessa, and their logbook showed that she had checked in before Frederick’s death. They also agreed that she had remained on the premises throughout.\n\nThe day Tessa was arrested, she displayed her usual calm demeanor. As the police handcuffed her, a metallic shine of a corkscrew slipped out from her apron pocket, landing on the ground below. This was her personal corkscrew, a tool she always had on hand for her routine work at the restaurant, and one that she was seen using frequently to open wine bottles during her shift.\n\nAs Winston left the motel to return to the precinct, he mused over the victim’s connection with Tessa. Frederick knew about Tessa’s considerable debt, and this was not ordinary behavior between a server and a regular patron. But for now, the facts just laid out the circumstances. His sole contribution to this puzzle would be to compile the facts so they could make sense. The rest — the swift execution of justice — was a matter of time. And Winston knew that time always brought the truth to light.\n\nWinston straightened his tie as he approached the scene of Frederick's murder, squinting under the motel's harsh fluorescent lighting. Frederick, a successful events planner, was stealing lucrative contracts right from Van’s territory. On the other hand, Van also managed to poach a few of Frederick's prime clients. Frederick's competitors saw his success as the rising spark of a problem they had to deal with. Someone like Van, maybe. \n\nVan. The one who was always behind a desk at every event he planned, for some reason avoiding any kind of physical exertion. For instance, at every event, he could be found refusing a spot in the robust, physically-demanding relay races that colleagues customarily participated in. That night was no different, the event was a wine tasting. Van would likely be there, not participating in the traditional grape-stomping competition. There, Van would flaunt his newly-acquired clients; the ones he had usurped from Frederick.\n\nWith this thought in his head, Winston drove over to the event, arriving to the sight of Van pouring wine expediently with a corkscrew for the event attendees instead of joining in on the active games. \n\n\"Van,\" Winston greeted, nodding at him.\n\n\"Detective,\" Van replied, raising an eyebrow. \n\nHe paused as Winston took a seat in front of him, then offered a bottle of red. \"Wine, Detective?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" Winston said, \"Don't you usually have an assistant to open wine bottles?\"\n\nVan laughed, shrugging off the observation easily. \"I like doing it. It's therapeutic,\" he said.\n\nThen there was the fresh dressing peeking out from under Van's cuff, the one he offered some vague explanation for, just like every other time Winston had seen him injured. He referred to these as ‘small accidents’.\n\nHe remembered what Van's colleagues had said about him. Always getting injured, never playing in any games, always behind a desk, and there was that thing with Frederick. \n\n\"Frederick,\" Winston started, both men looking somber at the mention of the recent murder.

Eleanor had been his pal, a local wrestling enthusiast, and her death had shaken him. She had once confided in Winston about Freya's illegal historical artifact transactions, and how she had personally invited Freya to her wrestling match out of concern for her. Freya, who had declared bankruptcy last month, had been loaned money by Eleanor to help fuel her obsession with historical artifacts. Eleanor had been uneasy about this, always threatening to expose Freya if she did not repay her substantial debt. \n\nEleanor's wrestling match, which was held in the public square and coincided with the weekend market, had attracted a large crowd. It was here that Freya had been seen by multiple people.

Interested in medieval weapons?”\n\nWinston nodded, eyeing her carefully maintained collection of historical artifacts. He couldn’t help but notice the halberd in her collection that matched the one found at the crime scene. \n\n“You must be getting some good deals on these artifacts, Freya, especially in consideration of your bankruptcy last month.” Winston casually commented.\n\n“We all have our investments, don’t we, Winston? The bankruptcy, it’s all in the past” Freya defensively replied.\n\nBefore leaving, Winston confirmed, “By the way, you do remember Eleanor’s wrestling match in the square, during the weekend market right?

He scanned the quaint details, turning each over in his mind. The setting was a temple, a peculiar choice within their community. Unique also, was the choice of Xenia as the wedding planner. A woman known for her fastidiousness and deft hands in crafting seamless events. \n\nIn a recent chat with Charlotte before her wedding, she mentioned a peculiar detail regarding a certain secret she was advised by Xenia to keep hidden - her past relationship with Xenia's current partner. It was a secret she was planning to unveil at the altar, a revelation that would surely raise a few eyebrows, with Xenia no longer being the lone keeper of it.\n\n\"Ms. Xenia, I presume?\" Winston asked, entering the wedding planner's office. \n\n\"Yes. How can I aid you detective?\" Xenia responded, with a slight surprise in her eyes.\n\n\"I wanted to talk about Charlotte's wedding... a ceremony that was slated to occur at the exact minute of her murder. Noticed anything unusual around those days?” Winston queried.\n\nXenia hesitated, her expression wavering. It was clear that the jab about Charlotte's intention to confess the past, which involved Xenia's significant other, had struck a nerve. The anger simmering in Xenia's eyes was volatile and intense, enough to make anyone uncomfortable.\n\nAs they conversed, Winston's attention drifted to an office closet, slightly ajar. A suitcase peeked from within, stuffed with neatly folded clothes, almost as though it was constantly ready for a trip. His colleagues had often mentioned seeing this suitcase during their routine meetings with Xenia.\n\n\"Ever much of a traveler, Xenia?\" Winston asked casually. \n\nShe seemed taken aback by his question. \"Sometimes... it's part of the job. Last minute trips for a desired decoration, or perhaps to get a gift. Weekend trips and all.\"\n\n\"That your suitcase in the closet, always packed and ready?\" Winston nodded towards it. Xenia followed his gaze toward the suitcase, then back at him. \"Yes, why?\" \n\n\"No reason,\" Winston shrugged. \"It’s just that colleagues have mentioned spotting you with your luggage at the airport, and at the train station buying tickets – during work hours.\"\n\n\"Yeah, like I said, travelling becomes part of the job sometimes,” countered Xenia, smoothly.\n\nThroughout their conversation about wedding preparations, Xenia specified that she was responsible for every minute detail – setting up and breaking down the décor, liaising with the temple people, overseeing every aspect of the event. She emphasized that her duties required her presence before, during, and after the ceremony. Winston mentally jotted this down, noticing how neatly these timings coincided with those of Charlotte's unfortunate fate.\n\nWinston rose to depart, conveying his gratitude, \"Thanks for your time.\"\n\n\"Of course, anything to help,\" Xenia replied softly. “Charlotte's passing is shocking, but remember, we rely on trust and reputation in our business. It's all we have. Charlotte's confession could have marred that.\"\n\nDetective Winston sifted through the papers littering his desk. Crime scene photos mixed with witness statements and information on both the victim, Charlotte, and the potential suspect, Priscilla. Winston ran a hand through his hair, taking a deep breath.\n\nEyewitness accounts placed Priscilla at the temple on the day of the crime. The same temple where Charlotte was found, her life taken by barbed wire. Winston's gaze drifted towards some photos of the hiking trails Priscilla was known to frequent. The trails, all too often, wound their way past the same temple where Charlotte met her end.\n\nPushing the papers around, Winston found a report from the local police. Priscilla's involvement with certain gang activities was far from a well-kept secret. The faded gang tattoos on Priscilla's skin were testament to her affiliation. Charlotte, on the other hand, was part of a rival gang, a fact anyone could see from the tags she left behind. \n\nPhotos from the trails Priscilla often hiked showed a significant amount of barbed wire fencing. Winston mused, barbed wire was indeed common along these trails - so much so that Priscilla had even learned to utilize items like it in her own survival knowledge on these hiking expeditions. \n\nA picture of Priscilla hiking caught Winston's attention. He noted the pair of wire snips she carried. Those would be potentially useful in dealing with the surplus of barbed wire on her usual trails. He also noted the rough timeline on the police report. Charlotte's time of death matched up too neatly with the time witnesses had spotted Priscilla at the temple that day.\n\n\"Interesting, isn't it?\" Winston muttered to himself, mulling over the facts at hand.

Xenia followed his gaze toward the suitcase, then back at him. \\\"Yes, why?\\\" \\n\\n\\\"No reason,\\\" Winston shrugged. \\\"It\\u2019s just that colleagues have mentioned spotting you with your luggage at the airport, and at the train station buying tickets \\u2013 during work hours.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yeah, like I said, travelling becomes part of the job sometimes,\\u201d countered Xenia, smoothly.\\n\\nThroughout their conversation about wedding preparations, Xenia specified that she was responsible for every minute detail \\u2013 setting up and breaking down the d\\u00e9cor, liaising with the temple people, overseeing every aspect of the event. She emphasized that her duties required her presence before, during, and after the ceremony. Winston mentally jotted this down, noticing how neatly these timings coincided with those of Charlotte's unfortunate fate.\\n\\nWinston rose to depart, conveying his gratitude, \\\"Thanks for your time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course, anything to help,\\\" Xenia replied softly. \\u201cCharlotte's passing is shocking, but remember, we rely on trust and reputation in our business. It's all we have. Charlotte's confession could have marred that.\\\"\\n\\nDetective Winston sifted through the papers littering his desk. Crime scene photos mixed with witness statements and information on both the victim, Charlotte, and the potential suspect, Priscilla. Winston ran a hand through his hair, taking a deep breath.\\n\\nEyewitness accounts placed Priscilla at the temple on the day of the crime. The same temple where Charlotte was found, her life taken by barbed wire. Winston's gaze drifted towards some photos of the hiking trails Priscilla was known to frequent. The trails, all too often, wound their way past the same temple where Charlotte met her end.\\n\\nPushing the papers around, Winston found a report from the local police. Priscilla's involvement with certain gang activities was far from a well-kept secret. The faded gang tattoos on Priscilla's skin were testament to her affiliation. Charlotte, on the other hand, was part of a rival gang, a fact anyone could see from the tags she left behind. \\n\\nPhotos from the trails Priscilla often hiked showed a significant amount of barbed wire fencing. Winston mused, barbed wire was indeed common along these trails - so much so that Priscilla had even learned to utilize items like it in her own survival knowledge on these hiking expeditions. \\n\\nA picture of Priscilla hiking caught Winston's attention. He noted the pair of wire snips she carried. Those would be potentially useful in dealing with the surplus of barbed wire on her usual trails. He also noted the rough timeline on the police report. Charlotte's time of death matched up too neatly with the time witnesses had spotted Priscilla at the temple that day.\\n\\n\\\"Interesting, isn't it?\\\" Winston muttered to himself, mulling over the facts at hand. Pushing his chair back, he decided it was time to ask Priscilla some questions.

Bad news was often paired with a country farm, but today was particularly grave - A death at the chalet, a bear trap, and a farmer named Gordon.\n\nWinston slowly climbed out of the car as he neared the farmhouse - a large wooden structure isolated in the distant country land, adjacent to a somber cemetery. The only cemetery in town, he thought. Isolated, just like Gordon, its only neighbor who immigrated here with no known family. Gordon had landed there, growing crops, breeding animals, keeping up a farm.\n\nHe walked up the pathway onto the farm, noticing the creaking wooden sign that read 'Gordon's Hunting Supplies'. It was evident that Gordon was more than just a standard farmer. The sign was riddled with buckshot. 'Bear problems,' Winston thought to himself as he made his way to the front door. \n\nGordon was sitting on a rickety wooden stool as Winston made his approach. He was weathered from years of outdoor work and his eyes carried an unmistakable lonesome pain. His fists were gripped around a wooden handle, tapping rhythmically onto the dry farm soil.

The hunting shop sign creaking in the wind was a well-known fixture having Gordon's name inscribed in bold on the top. Winston knew very well that the shop was run by Gordon, who was as good a supplier of hunting equipment as he was a farmer. The murder of Harry, now known in newspapers as \"The Chalet Bear Trap Murder,\" had to be untangled.\n\nIn front of Winston, a rough-faced man, smeared with sweat and dust from his work at both the shop and the farm, set to work, carrying feed bags to the barn. It was Gordon, the local farmer in question.\n\n\"Hello, Gordon,\" - Winston greeted him.\n\n\"Howdy, got no time to chat. Gotta feed the animals before the weather worsens. These parts, we got some bear problems,\" - Gordon grunted in response.\n\nCatching a break, Winston moved towards the subject. \"I heard you had some form of disagreement with Harry at the farmer's market a while back.\"\n\nScoffing, Gordon refused to meet his gaze. \"Sure, we had words... I wasn't selling much, and he was selling everything. Fella won an award recently for his agricultural products while the market for my products was going under.\"\n\n\"You blame Harry for that?\" - Winston asked, laying the facts bare.\n\n\"Goddam right I do...\" - Gordon muttered, throwing a dirty sack onto a pile.\n\n\"Where were you at the time Harry was killed, Gordon?\"\n\nThe farmer dusted his hands, meeting Winston's gaze with defiance. \"I was here, at the farm. All day. You can ask anyone around.\"\n\n“As for the chalet where poor Harry met his end...\" - Winston started.\n\n“Yeah, Harry was at my chalet. It’s my property, and I’m the who decides who can or can't access it.\" - Gordon interrupted, more flustered now.\n\n\"Did you see anyone else around that day?\"\n\n\"Nope. Quiet as a mouse that day, just the bears and me.\"\n\nAfter that, silence fell over the now dark homestead. Winston considered the facts, the countryside, farm, bears, the market, the struggling sales, it all called for further investigation. But for now, he just tipped his hat and walked back to his car under the drizzling rain, leaving a brooding Gordon to his work.\n\nAs the sheer size of the chalet murder scene could overwhelm a lesser detective, Winston, stood firm. The victim, Harry, was a known critic within the food industry. His sharp tongue had a penchant for landing him in a hot stew of trouble. This time, it would seem, there was a rogue ingredient he just couldn't swallow.\n\nWinston strolled over to Dexter, a known acquaintance of Harry's and an avid food enthusiast himself. The man's love for fine cuisine was matched only by his fervour for his religion.\n\n\"Evening, Dexter,\" Winston began. \"How are you holding up?\"\n\n\"I'm doing okay... under the circumstances.\" Dexter wasn't the most expressive despite his harsh critiques.\n\n\"I heard Harry was very open about his thoughts on your religious beliefs,\" Winston continued.\n\nDexter sighed, \"Yes, he publicly mocked my faith during an event. Disrespectful, but that was just Harry.\"\n\n\"Dexter,\" Winston turned back to him, \"I noticed a photograph of you and Tony the Tooth having dinner together surfaced on social media. Where were you the night of Harry's death?\"\n\n\"I... I was there, having dinner with Tony, known to his friends as 'Tony the Tooth,' I've recently learned.\"\n\nWinston paused at the mention of that name. Tony the Tooth’s reputation proceeded him. Known as a racketeer and money launderer, his guilty verdict in a recent court case was infamous. Dexter's association with him, especially in a photograph in a restaurant notoriously frequented by other criminals, only bred more suspicion.\n\nChanging tactics, Winston delved into Dexter's rural interests. Dexter's love for hunting was no secret to the community; he was often seen in the woods around the outskirts of the town. Dexter was not only known for his hobby of collecting hunting equipment but also for his knowledge of various hunting techniques. One of the common pieces of equipment in his collection was bear traps, which he frequently used in the woods. Dexter was often seen studying these traps, enhancing his understanding of them.\n\n\"Care to show me your hunting gear?\" Winston suddenly asked, catching him off guard.\n\n\"Sure, I guess,\" Dexter replied tensely. He led the way to a shed, where hunting equipment including rifles and the commonly used bear traps littered the floor and walls.\n\n\"It's quite the collection,\" Dexter added, trying to read Winston's face.\n\nWinston, however, didn't respond. He scribbled down a few more notes before thanking Dexter for his time and heading back to his car.

It was Gordon, the local farmer in question.\\n\\n\\\"Hello, Gordon,\\\" - Winston greeted him.\\n\\n\\\"Howdy, got no time to chat. Gotta feed the animals before the weather worsens. These parts, we got some bear problems,\\\" - Gordon grunted in response.\\n\\nCatching a break, Winston moved towards the subject. \\\"I heard you had some form of disagreement with Harry at the farmer's market a while back.\\\"\\n\\nScoffing, Gordon refused to meet his gaze. \\\"Sure, we had words... I wasn't selling much, and he was selling everything. Fella won an award recently for his agricultural products while the market for my products was going under.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You blame Harry for that?\\\" - Winston asked, laying the facts bare.\\n\\n\\\"Goddam right I do...\\\" - Gordon muttered, throwing a dirty sack onto a pile.\\n\\n\\\"Where were you at the time Harry was killed, Gordon?\\\"\\n\\nThe farmer dusted his hands, meeting Winston's gaze with defiance. \\\"I was here, at the farm. All day. You can ask anyone around.\\\"\\n\\n\\u201cAs for the chalet where poor Harry met his end...\\\" - Winston started.\\n\\n\\u201cYeah, Harry was at my chalet. It\\u2019s my property, and I\\u2019m the who decides who can or can't access it.\\\" - Gordon interrupted, more flustered now.\\n\\n\\\"Did you see anyone else around that day?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nope. Quiet as a mouse that day, just the bears and me.\\\"\\n\\nAfter that, silence fell over the now dark homestead. Winston considered the facts, the countryside, farm, bears, the market, the struggling sales, it all called for further investigation. But for now, he just tipped his hat and walked back to his car under the drizzling rain, leaving a brooding Gordon to his work.\\n\\nAs the sheer size of the chalet murder scene could overwhelm a lesser detective, Winston, stood firm. The victim, Harry, was a known critic within the food industry. His sharp tongue had a penchant for landing him in a hot stew of trouble. This time, it would seem, there was a rogue ingredient he just couldn't swallow.\\n\\nWinston strolled over to Dexter, a known acquaintance of Harry's and an avid food enthusiast himself. The man's love for fine cuisine was matched only by his fervour for his religion.\\n\\n\\\"Evening, Dexter,\\\" Winston began. \\\"How are you holding up?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm doing okay... under the circumstances.\\\" Dexter wasn't the most expressive despite his harsh critiques.\\n\\n\\\"I heard Harry was very open about his thoughts on your religious beliefs,\\\" Winston continued.\\n\\nDexter sighed, \\\"Yes, he publicly mocked my faith during an event. Disrespectful, but that was just Harry.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dexter,\\\" Winston turned back to him, \\\"I noticed a photograph of you and Tony the Tooth having dinner together surfaced on social media. Where were you the night of Harry's death?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I... I was there, having dinner with Tony, known to his friends as 'Tony the Tooth,' I've recently learned.\\\"\\n\\nWinston paused at the mention of that name. Tony the Tooth\\u2019s reputation proceeded him. Known as a racketeer and money launderer, his guilty verdict in a recent court case was infamous. Dexter's association with him, especially in a photograph in a restaurant notoriously frequented by other criminals, only bred more suspicion.\\n\\nChanging tactics, Winston delved into Dexter's rural interests. Dexter's love for hunting was no secret to the community; he was often seen in the woods around the outskirts of the town. Dexter was not only known for his hobby of collecting hunting equipment but also for his knowledge of various hunting techniques. One of the common pieces of equipment in his collection was bear traps, which he frequently used in the woods. Dexter was often seen studying these traps, enhancing his understanding of them.\\n\\n\\\"Care to show me your hunting gear?\\\" Winston suddenly asked, catching him off guard.\\n\\n\\\"Sure, I guess,\\\" Dexter replied tensely. He led the way to a shed, where hunting equipment including rifles and the commonly used bear traps littered the floor and walls.\\n\\n\\\"It's quite the collection,\\\" Dexter added, trying to read Winston's face.\\n\\nWinston, however, didn't respond. He scribbled down a few more notes before thanking Dexter for his time and heading back to his car. His head was awash with the evening's revelations, notably Dexter's disrespect and his surprising dinner partner.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Dexter\\n(b) - Gordon\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(a) - Dexter"]], "filtered_resps": ["(a)"], "doc_hash": "7a7eb73e3cd69ede0798edcd50279b96287daa632760117c127e23c641f708be", "prompt_hash": "35ca5c056ed85a292b4adf8395dbbaf7d480b138592cc98ec2467e85d554e0e3", "target_hash": "f89bf797c3b1dda4ee48380783e5e979067686a6a9540c5a40e8d75ae5f3d199", "exact_match": 1.0}

But what was even more unusual was the murder weapon used: a meat cleaver.\n\nReviewing the details of the case once more, Winston thought about some key players involved. Undeniably traceable was Gloria, a hardcore fan of the rock band 'The Butchers', known by everyone and even herself in interviews, as a groupie. She had also confessed in one such media interaction that she was crazy about taxidermy, a hobby brought to life in her house.\n\nLeaving the crime scene, Winston made his way to Gloria's house in the fading evening sun.

Home explosions were not commonly dealt with in his line of work, though he knew very well that such explosives were often used in demolitions. \n\nWith such knowledge, he was reminded of a local surfing instructor who also took part in an unconventional part-time job that would put him in frequent touch with explosives, training weekly on handling and disposal. This wasn't his usual surfing job but his part-time work as a demolition worker. This was no doubt, Patrick.\n\nFinding his interview notes with Patrick, Winston decided it was time to speak with him again. Winston had known Patrick through his work, not because he surfed but because of his other role in demolition, an occupation that naturally involved a great deal of work with explosives.\n\nWinston set off to the beach in search of Patrick, eventually spotting him as he was patiently teaching a young boy how to ride the waves. \"Patrick!\" he called out to him.\n\nRecognizing Winston, the man navigated back to shore on his surfboard with a practised ease. \"Detective Winston,\" he greeted, wiping the saltwater off his face. \"How can I help you?\"\n\n\"Just a few questions,\" Winston replied. He opened his notebook to a page of carefully penned notes about Patrick's financial troubles. \"I heard that you've been having some trouble... getting into a failed investment, left with a sizeable debt?”\n\nPatrick's face tightened, but he nodded in admission. \"That's right. Lost all my savings, even borrowed a huge amount from Angela, but the investment went under.\"  \n\n\"Angela had been lending you money, huh?\" Winston asked, wanting to confirm the loan from Angela. \"And you haven't been able to pay her back because you lost your main job?\"\n\n“That’s correct, detective,” the man answered, his face grim with the weight of his troubles.\n\n\"Angela ever threaten to, oh, say, call the police on you?\" Winston casually asked, inspecting the worn strap of his watch.\n\nPatrick hesitated before finally sighing and admitting, \"Yes, she did. More than once. I guess she had enough of my money problems and empty promises.\"\n\nSomewhat satisfied, Winston took down the latest confession. Glancing around the beach, he then asked, \"You were around Angela's house the evening of the explosion?\" \n\n\"Detective... it's not far from here, I often pass by when I go home,\" Patrick replied, his face tense at the questioning.\n\n\"Well, nobody else was around her place at that time,\" Winston mentioned, \"Just an interesting fact.\"\n\nIn the awkward silence that followed, Winston then asked about the part that bothered him the most. \"You use explosives much with your part-time work and your frequent training, Patrick?\" \n\nPatrick seemed to straighten, “I have, yes, in controlled environments and with appropriate permits.” His voice was firm, perhaps a little defensive.\n\n\"Right, part of the job, I guess,\" Winston nodded, closing his notebook. Not another word was spoken between them as he walked away, leaving a nervous Patrick behind.\n\nWinston gave a slow pull from his coffee as he sat across from Alvin, the typically even-tempered delivery man whose vehicle was loaded and ready for his daily route through town. Alvin's calm demeanor had earned him a reputation among the townsfolk as reliable, if not a tad peculiar due to his habit of having his lunch beside graves. \n\nAlvin's reliable routine encompassed the entire town including the cemetery - on today's agenda, he'd be stopping at Angela's to drop off a package. His daily routines had put him on a first-name basis with Angela, as she always made a point to personally welcome him into her home when he arrived with her deliveries. \n\n\"So Alvin, any big plans for today?\" Winston asked, making casual conversation. \"Oh yes,\" Alvin replied, a spark in his usually placid eyes. \"I've just bought a vintage Victorian-era coffin from an auction. Also, I am picking up some decommissioned explosives from a contact in the military. They're for a historical display I'm working on. Can't wait to get both set up in the living room.\"\n\nThis interest didn't surprise Winston. Alvin was known to frequent antique shops, specifically those that boasted a range of mortuary relics. It was odd, sure, but Alvin being odd was one of the few things that gave him character. \n\n\"Did you know Angela?\" he asked Alvin in a low tone, a hint of suspicion in his voice. Alvin nodded, \"Yes. I deliver her packages regularly. Also,\" he said after a pause, \"I was due to deliver a package to her today.\"\n\nThat tidbit of information Winston knew. Angela was home that day to get her package, but she had not been prepared for what the delivery contained. The investigation revealed that the fatal box delivered to Angela's house was filled with explosives, and the only man who Winston knew had any experience with such devices was Alvin.\n\nAlvin’s past in the military gave him the exposure and knowledge about explosives that most people didn't have. It was common knowledge in their tight-knit community where personal histories were difficult to conceal. While this knowledge alone didn’t constitute evidence, it was certainly one fact of many that were swirling around in Winston’s head.\n\nAs Alvin got up to leave, Winston gave him a tight smile, \"I hope you enjoy setting up your new coffin and your explosives display, Alvin,\" he said. “Thank you,” Alvin replied, oblivious to any undercurrent in the conversation, his calm demeanor never wavering. \n\nWinston finished his coffee, his mind firmly focused on the explosion that had taken Angela's life, the package that had been delivered, and questions that were begging to be answered.", "question": "Who is the most likely murderer?", "choices": "['Patrick', 'Alvin']", "answer_index": 0, "answer_choice": "Patrick"}, "target": "(`)", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": ["[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please answer the following question with (a), (b), (c), (d) \\n\\nIn the aftermath of a devastating home explosion that claims the life of Angela, seasoned Detective Winston hones in on two prime suspects: Patrick and Alvin.\\n\\nDetective Winston grimly regarded the charred remains of Angela's home, considering the pieces of evidence.

{"doc_id": 205, "doc": {"narrative": "In the aftermath of a devastating home explosion that claims the life of Angela, seasoned Detective Winston hones in on two prime suspects: Patrick and Alvin.\n\nDetective Winston winced a little as he pulled up to Angela's home. What was once a well kept, welcoming residence was now charred remains. All due to an explosion powerful enough to shake the neighborhood. As he began his investigation into the events leading up to the incident, one name kept surfacing: Patrick, local surfing instructor and part-time demolition worker who frequently had to handle, use, and was often training on disposing explosives at his job as a requirement of safety measures.\n \nTo understand this suspect more, Winston set off to meet the man at his next surfing lesson. Under the blistering sun, Patrick was there, quick to anger, bellowing at his students who seemed more frightened than focused on the waves. Several students have had grievances about his harsh teaching methods, which translated to Winston as a lack of patience.\n\nWhen the session started, Winston noticed the scar that ran down the side of his face which looked ill-treated. Patrick noticed him too. His tall and sturdy figure smirked and sauntered towards Winston. \"Detective, right?\" his voice was rough, like sandpaper against a rough surface. \"Heard about Angela, disturbing really.\" \n\nPatrick's nonchalance bothered Winston, but he gave an understanding nod. \"Yeah, it is. You were doing demolition work part-time, handling and using explosives, and even have been frequently training on disposing of them, right? That could surely be a dangerous work, isn't it?\" Winston queried.\n\n\"Sure is,\" Patrick answered, side-glancing towards his students who were still trying to catch a wave, \"Just like surfing, you know, it's all about control.\" \n\nLater, Winston found out from the old records that Patrick once worked in a prison. An inmate had assaulted him, and despite being injured, he'd managed to subdue the prisoner. The incident had left him off fieldwork due to minor injuries, but his bravery had been noted. \n\nWinston also learned that Patrick borrowed a large sum of money from Angela. A neighbor heard Angela frequently threatening to call the cops on Patrick, but he was always around. Patrick had been seen near Angela's home that evening, the very scene of the explosion. There were no others found in the vicinity at the time.\n\nNow, it seemed Winston was dealing with a surfing instructor who vented his frustrations on his students, an injured prison-personnel-turned-demolition-worker with frequent training on handling and disposing explosives who borrowed heavily from a woman who is now dead and was glimpsed around her house before the explosion. Interesting, certainly, but Winston knew there was more to uncover before any real pieces could begin to fall into place here. This was just the start.\n\nWinston sat in his car, surveying through the battered fence that surrounded Angela's suburban home. The yellow tape marking off the scene of the crime fluttered eerily in the wind. Within that marked perimeter was devastation... an explosion had taken place there recently.\n\nAs Winston stepped out of his vehicle, a mail truck adorned with cheerful, vibrant colors pulled up to a house down the street. It was Alvin, a well-liked figure in the community, known best for his calm demeanor and reliability. Ex-military, he was now a delivery man and today, just like every day, he was doing his rounds. Along with the rumors of Alvin's unusual fascination with Angela and his tendency to lurk outside her home during unexpected hours, several witnesses had observed Alvin frequently retreating to his garage, where he kept a collection of various artifacts, including explosives and old photos of Angela.\n\nAlvin had scheduled stops all over the neighborhood, but Angela - the victim in Winston's case - was one that he had on his list daily. It was on Alvin's delivery sheet that day too - a package was scheduled for Angela's house. Always punctual, Alvin would hand-deliver packages to Angela; she was always home to receive them, waiting for him at her front door with a box of his old photos of her flashed to Alvin’s mind. \n\nAngela's old housekeeper clued Winston in on something else.

Inside was Sophie, his latest person of interest, who had gained notoriety for expressing racist viewpoints at several social gatherings. Witnesses and victims had come forth, stating that Sophie, in her fury, had confronted and threatened individuals belonging to the groups she so openly expressed prejudice against.\n\nSophie, who was known for her athletic prowess as a professional trident thrower, was amid an intense workout when Winston entered the facility. She was preparing for an upcoming competition, her muscles rippling under the strain of each precise throw. Her unlimited access to the gym's professional equipment made this process much easier.\n\nWinston approached her once she finished her practice throws. \"Ms. Sophie,\" he greeted, his gaze unwavering.\n\nShe turned, her eyes blazing with a competitive energy. \"Detective Winston,\" she replied. \"Can I help you?\"\n\n\"Maybe. I'm asking around about a gym guest, Stephen. He was part of your clientele, wasn't he?\" He knew the answer, having found that Stephen visited this gym regularly.\n\nSophie's expression hardened. \"Yes,\" she confirmed. \"So what?\"\n\n\"Stephen has been murdered in the library downtown.\" Winston noticed Sophie's eyes flicker with surprise, or guilt perhaps. Sophie knew Stephen's routine well. His unusual, long hours spent at the library coincided with the time of the crime, a detail Sophie was well aware of. \n\nSophie looked genuinely shocked. \"Library?\" she echoed, her brows furrowing.\n\n\"Yes, the library. Quite an unusual scene, isn't it? Especially when we found a trident near his body. It happens to be identical to the kind here in your gym,\" Winston added.\n\nImmediately, Sophie blanched. She swiveled her head towards the impressive array of trident equipment, nervously mimicking a laugh. “A trident?” she repeated, “Yes… we do have tridents here for… for our clients.”\n\nWinston changed his line of questioning. \"Stephen belonged to a particular minority group, didn't he?

Despite the usual shock and upset that strikes most people after such incidents, Lowell appeared almost unfazed, as if it were just another everyday occurrence clashing against his jaded facade.\n\nWinston followed up on an evening invitation for a soiree at Lowell's house. This wasn't his usual cup of tea, but he knew it was an opportunity to further explore Lowell's world. The conductor's soirées were known for their unique purpose - showcasing his collection of antiquities, curiosities of historical relevance, and one particular item that never failed to impress. \n\nLowell's fascination with weapons was widely known, but his pride was his trident, an instrument whose history and significance he appeared to comprehend in great depth. The antiquated weapon was a focal point of fascination among his guests, a point of conversation that led to their visible amazement.\n\nWhile at the soirée, Winston overheard a brief interaction between Lowell and another attendee. The person congratulated Lowell on his raise, expressed condolences for a colleague's recent loss, and inquired about his frequent early morning deliveries to the library. Despite the layered complexities of the conversation, Lowell appeared untroubled, revealing no physical signs of sadness or empathy, and mentioned the solitary nature of his early morning deliveries.

Despite the usual shock and upset that strikes most people after such incidents, Lowell appeared almost unfazed, as if it were just another everyday occurrence clashing against his jaded facade.\\n\\nWinston followed up on an evening invitation for a soiree at Lowell's house. This wasn't his usual cup of tea, but he knew it was an opportunity to further explore Lowell's world. The conductor's soir\\u00e9es were known for their unique purpose - showcasing his collection of antiquities, curiosities of historical relevance, and one particular item that never failed to impress. \\n\\nLowell's fascination with weapons was widely known, but his pride was his trident, an instrument whose history and significance he appeared to comprehend in great depth. The antiquated weapon was a focal point of fascination among his guests, a point of conversation that led to their visible amazement.\\n\\nWhile at the soir\\u00e9e, Winston overheard a brief interaction between Lowell and another attendee. The person congratulated Lowell on his raise, expressed condolences for a colleague's recent loss, and inquired about his frequent early morning deliveries to the library. Despite the layered complexities of the conversation, Lowell appeared untroubled, revealing no physical signs of sadness or empathy, and mentioned the solitary nature of his early morning deliveries. Small talk it may have seemed, these snippets of conversation provided Winston with yet another view into the intricate, strange life of Lowell.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Sophie\\n(b) - Lowell\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(a) - Sophie"]], "filtered_resps": ["(a)"], "doc_hash": "be97f597ce31a1c1639fecc1dcba868dbd2afd0a60cfdf833d2495e2ce7b16e9", "prompt_hash": "658c7ea12030df8c9f37fc53c1d3d951f3810ad278b99066ea513c00e5cb3302", "target_hash": "e300f251dc09073a9781733cd99758d04a98290157b77fb5c4a986b123900fc6", "exact_match": 0.0}

{"doc_id": 209, "doc": {"narrative": "In the once tranquil mosque, tragedy struck as Jamal was brutally shot dead, and now it's up to Detective Winston to weave through the tangled web of secrets Mark and Gerald are entwined in.\n\nWinston took a moment to clear his mind, the large white mosque in front of him only a backdrop to the chaos of scattered investigators and onlookers. The high profile murder of Jamal had the community on edge. \n\nA commotion caught his attention as a man named Gerald was directed towards him; a towering figure, with shaky hands that contradicted his hard-set eyes.\n\n\"Are you Winston?\" Gerald's voice was soft as he extended his hand to the detective. \n\n\"Indeed,\" Winston replied, examining the intricate movement of Gerald's fingers as he played with his jacket. \"Play an instrument?\"\n\n\"Aw, already caught me out, did you?\" Gerald laughed. \"I play the violin. Lot of class and vitality in a violin.\"\n\n\"Must have steady hands for something like that\" Winston noted. The thought of handling a violin, and a shotgun, involved a high level of similar dexterity.\n\nOn Gerald's way out, Winston caught the surveillance monitor playing a video taken earlier that day. It was Gerald, entering the mosque just as the midday prayers were set to commence. This was a ritualistic routine for Gerald, arriving before the midday prayers began and always praying fervently during that time; the same time the murder happened, Detective Winston had learned during the investigation.\n\nWinston decided to mingle with the on-goers, to see what he could gather. A local community meeting was in action, and he discovered an old friend of Gerald's named Arnold. Arnold mentioned that Gerald had openly discussed his fear of Jamal's charisma in front of the entire community during a meeting, and how he, Gerald, feels inferior to such captivating influence. Gerald's deep involvement within the mosque's day-to-day activities seemed unquestioned, even though he was openly scared of Jamal's charismatic hold on the people. \n\nListening further, Winston discovered that Gerald was well-respected amongst the community, and was legally allowed to purchase firearms due to having a clean record.\n\nMeeting Gerald again for a one-on-one, Arnold was present, making the interaction more personal. Gerald admitted to them both about his feelings of inferiority to Jamal's vast influence. \n\n\"Gerald,\" Winston asked, \"A week before Jamal was murdered, where were you?\"\n\nGerald swallowed, \"Well, I was out purchasing a new shotgun. Why?\"\n\nWinston simply nodded and said, \"Just collecting the facts. That's all.\" \n\nHe ended the conversation soon after that, wanting to get back to the office to review the evidence. As Winston watched Gerald walk away, his mind replayed their conversation. An undercurrent of fear seemed to wash over Gerald whenever Jamal's name was mentioned. But that was all facts. Nothing more.\n\nWinston was at the crime scene, a deserted mosque, when he received news that a suspect had been identified. Mark, a local lawyer, reputed for representing law enforcement personnel was due to be interviewed. His résumé was diverse and impressive, having in several cases represented law enforcement personnel from whom he obtained extensive knowledge about firearms. As a lawyer, Mark was often called upon to play a vital role in ensuring the safety and well-being of his community while protecting the law enforcement personnel who kept it safe. Despite the sacred surroundings, a chill ran through Winston. \n\nMark's office was filled with a faint scent of cologne and smoke. A number of law enforcement badges and hats met Winston's sight. \"I have worked with a lot of your kind,\" responded Mark when asked about the artifacts. \n\nWinston then asked Mark if he had any known meetings today. Mark responded, \"Yes, it was a standard law firm meeting with my colleagues.\" He paused for a moment before adding, \"You know how it goes, lots of talk. And if participants thought I was repeating lines from true crime documentaries, they were right – I sometimes do it to make my point.\"\n\nThe conversation drifted to hobbies. Mark mentioned that he enjoyed watching true crime documentaries late into the night. He mentioned that the complex structures of these crimes and the chase to find answers gave him a thrill. \"Makes me relive my cases without actually being involved. In fact, I'm constantly quoting lines from one of these during my meetings,\" he chuckled. \"My neighbour probably knows about this too. He once told me he noticed my TV on late into the night.\"\n\nOne interesting fact Winston discovered was that Mark had successfully handled cases involving firearm charges. He asked Mark about this. \"That's part of my job, after all,\" Mark replied. \"Dealing with such cases is a part of ensuring the safety of this community.\"\n\nThe subject of firearms led Winston to ask if Mark had purchased any ammunition recently. With a raised eyebrow, Mark replied, \"You're right. I did buy a couple of boxes of shotgun shells from the local store. Just wanted to know more about it from a personal perspective. The clerk even confirmed my purchase,\" he shrugged. \n\nSeeing no point in beating around the bush, Winston then asked Mark about Jamal. There was momentarily a flicker of fear that flashed across Mark's face before he turned stoic again. Mark confessed he had interacted with Jamal on a few occasions where community members expressed concerns about Jamal's extremist ideas to him. These ideas had scared him. He had confessed to a friend about his fears and it looked like a nightmare coming true.\n\n\"There's a thin line between ideas and action, detective,\" Mark's voice was barely above a whisper, \"Unfortunately, some people don't realize it until it's too late\".\n\nAs Mark was sending Winston out, he whispered, \"And between you and me, it freaks my neighbor out. The only thing he says he can hear is the distinct audio from my late-night true crime documentaries.\"\n\nWinston left the law firm office with a weary sigh.

Lot of class and vitality in a violin.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Must have steady hands for something like that\\\" Winston noted. The thought of handling a violin, and a shotgun, involved a high level of similar dexterity.\\n\\nOn Gerald's way out, Winston caught the surveillance monitor playing a video taken earlier that day. It was Gerald, entering the mosque just as the midday prayers were set to commence. This was a ritualistic routine for Gerald, arriving before the midday prayers began and always praying fervently during that time; the same time the murder happened, Detective Winston had learned during the investigation.\\n\\nWinston decided to mingle with the on-goers, to see what he could gather. A local community meeting was in action, and he discovered an old friend of Gerald's named Arnold. Arnold mentioned that Gerald had openly discussed his fear of Jamal's charisma in front of the entire community during a meeting, and how he, Gerald, feels inferior to such captivating influence. Gerald's deep involvement within the mosque's day-to-day activities seemed unquestioned, even though he was openly scared of Jamal's charismatic hold on the people. \\n\\nListening further, Winston discovered that Gerald was well-respected amongst the community, and was legally allowed to purchase firearms due to having a clean record.\\n\\nMeeting Gerald again for a one-on-one, Arnold was present, making the interaction more personal. Gerald admitted to them both about his feelings of inferiority to Jamal's vast influence. \\n\\n\\\"Gerald,\\\" Winston asked, \\\"A week before Jamal was murdered, where were you?\\\"\\n\\nGerald swallowed, \\\"Well, I was out purchasing a new shotgun. Why?\\\"\\n\\nWinston simply nodded and said, \\\"Just collecting the facts. That's all.\\\" \\n\\nHe ended the conversation soon after that, wanting to get back to the office to review the evidence. As Winston watched Gerald walk away, his mind replayed their conversation. An undercurrent of fear seemed to wash over Gerald whenever Jamal's name was mentioned. But that was all facts. Nothing more.\\n\\nWinston was at the crime scene, a deserted mosque, when he received news that a suspect had been identified. Mark, a local lawyer, reputed for representing law enforcement personnel was due to be interviewed. His r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 was diverse and impressive, having in several cases represented law enforcement personnel from whom he obtained extensive knowledge about firearms. As a lawyer, Mark was often called upon to play a vital role in ensuring the safety and well-being of his community while protecting the law enforcement personnel who kept it safe. Despite the sacred surroundings, a chill ran through Winston. \\n\\nMark's office was filled with a faint scent of cologne and smoke. A number of law enforcement badges and hats met Winston's sight. \\\"I have worked with a lot of your kind,\\\" responded Mark when asked about the artifacts. \\n\\nWinston then asked Mark if he had any known meetings today. Mark responded, \\\"Yes, it was a standard law firm meeting with my colleagues.\\\" He paused for a moment before adding, \\\"You know how it goes, lots of talk. And if participants thought I was repeating lines from true crime documentaries, they were right \\u2013 I sometimes do it to make my point.\\\"\\n\\nThe conversation drifted to hobbies. Mark mentioned that he enjoyed watching true crime documentaries late into the night. He mentioned that the complex structures of these crimes and the chase to find answers gave him a thrill. \\\"Makes me relive my cases without actually being involved. In fact, I'm constantly quoting lines from one of these during my meetings,\\\" he chuckled. \\\"My neighbour probably knows about this too. He once told me he noticed my TV on late into the night.\\\"\\n\\nOne interesting fact Winston discovered was that Mark had successfully handled cases involving firearm charges. He asked Mark about this. \\\"That's part of my job, after all,\\\" Mark replied. \\\"Dealing with such cases is a part of ensuring the safety of this community.\\\"\\n\\nThe subject of firearms led Winston to ask if Mark had purchased any ammunition recently. With a raised eyebrow, Mark replied, \\\"You're right. I did buy a couple of boxes of shotgun shells from the local store. Just wanted to know more about it from a personal perspective. The clerk even confirmed my purchase,\\\" he shrugged. \\n\\nSeeing no point in beating around the bush, Winston then asked Mark about Jamal. There was momentarily a flicker of fear that flashed across Mark's face before he turned stoic again. Mark confessed he had interacted with Jamal on a few occasions where community members expressed concerns about Jamal's extremist ideas to him. These ideas had scared him. He had confessed to a friend about his fears and it looked like a nightmare coming true.\\n\\n\\\"There's a thin line between ideas and action, detective,\\\" Mark's voice was barely above a whisper, \\\"Unfortunately, some people don't realize it until it's too late\\\".\\n\\nAs Mark was sending Winston out, he whispered, \\\"And between you and me, it freaks my neighbor out. The only thing he says he can hear is the distinct audio from my late-night true crime documentaries.\\\"\\n\\nWinston left the law firm office with a weary sigh. He knew he had a long night ahead of him, fishing for answers, following leads, exhausting every possibility until he could bring justice to Jamal.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Mark\\n(b) - Gerald\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(b) - Gerald"]], "filtered_resps": ["(b)"], "doc_hash": "f56803e5ee2a8380c82c043682142ee224317ea4ae37c486bdf5fbf917888ef1", "prompt_hash": "05c75eb42e7b4d714e61768d11016e52504b5c67023d5dde4ef088cccad8eccb", "target_hash": "f89bf797c3b1dda4ee48380783e5e979067686a6a9540c5a40e8d75ae5f3d199", "exact_match": 0.0}

They were standing on the edge of the football field where the murder had taken place.\n\n\"Sophia,\" Winston nodded, looking out at the half-time huddle of sweaty, tired players - the same scene where Savannah had taken her last breath. \n\nSophia was a journalist. She'd been covering the match when Savannah was killed, following her usual line of reportage. Today, she'd been on the field, right where it all happened. Savannah's murder had occurred right at halftime and yet, nobody seemed to know anything. \n\n\"So, it's been a while since your reports on the military exhibition, correct?\" Winston asked, keeping his face calm but watchful to catch any change in her expression.\n\n\"Yeah,  it was a couple of months ago. I still have the flamethrower I'd managed to keep, for research and, you know... reminders,\" Sophia said, her gaze flickering toward the field. \n\nWinston nodded. He knew that keeping memorabilia wasn't uncommon in her trade. Did it provide Sophia with a flamethrower when she needed one?\n\n\"Savannah, were you two friends?\" Winston asked, keeping an eye on the middle of the field where everything had happened.\n\n\"We knew each other... She threatened to reveal my source, ruin my credibility,\" Sophia sighed, staring at her untouched coffee. \n\nSophia's job was at stake, Winston knew; in a field like journalism, credibility mattered.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell anyone about the threat?\" \n\nSophia shifted uncomfortably, \"I had heavily invested time and energy in this article. I was protecting my...trust in the field. My source was my lifeline.\" \n\nWinston didn't reply but noted her skittishness in revealing her source even now.\n\n\"Look, the match is starting!\" Sophia pointed out to the field as the whistle blew.\n\nWinston just nodded, eyeing the field where the murder had taken place. If he was to solve this case, he had to sift through the evidence slowly and carefully. Even when it came from a journalist faced with the threat of losing her job and credibility.

Savannah, who was leading in the polls, was clearly the people's choice for the election. The upcoming political rally had been plastered about town for weeks, making it an inevitability known to all.\n\nWinston scratched at an internal itch and trudged onto another stakeout. Larry, the man he was looking to question, was apparently active in a local survivalist group. Flipping open his notebook, Winston noted that Larry was a war veteran who had gone to significant lengths campaigning himself. Posters of Larry bearing the tagline \"Whatever it takes\" dotted the town too.\n\nWinston watched as Larry scrutinized each one with such intensity that it seemed like his entire identity was tied to the outcome of this election. The survivalist meetings took place in Larry's private property, which he had converted into a fortified camp after pumping his entire fortune into his campaign.\n\nWinston decided to pay a visit to Larry to know more about him and his involvement in the race. They met at Larry's camp, a spit-and-polish place that reflected Larry's military background. Crisp flags snapped in the wind and the entire setting was punctuated by the distinct scent of gun oil.\n\n\"Thank you for your service,\" Winston began, extending a handshake to Larry who returned it with an iron grip. It's well-known that war veterans like Larry are experienced with various forms of weaponry, including flamethrowers. True to this, an errant flamethrower was left out in the open at his camp, catching Winston's eye. A flame thrower, not entirely strange for a survivalist's camp, was an interesting detail, considering the bizarre circumstances of Savannah's death.\n\nAs they chatted, Winston learned that Larry and Savannah were political rivals. Larry preferred to attend every rally personally. In fact, even though they stood on opposing political platforms, Larry never missed any of Savannah's rallies.\n\n\"I respect my opponent,\" said Larry, his gaze distant. \"It's her policies I have a problem with.\"\n\nWinston wrapped up the brief visit with a polite nod. As he left Larry's camp, the veteran-turned-politician watched with a grim smile that left Winston looking back at Savannah's campaign poster with a different perspective.\n\nUnder the harsh whiteness of the police station lights, Winston eyed the smartly dressed woman with a critical gaze. Sophia, they called her. A journalist. She was a fine-boned woman, older, maybe late forties, with a reputation for relentless pursuit of stories.

She looked him directly in the eyes, without a hint of evasion. \"I am entrusted with sometimes sensitive information. I don't lie or hide truths, detective. I take my job quite seriously.\"\n\nSeeing her intensity, Winston was not surprised. She was invested in her career, in truth-seeking, more than most. But her career, it seemed to Winston, was teetering on the edge. His notes said something about job stability issues.\n\n\"I heard from various sources that your job as a journalist could be at risk, Sophia.\"\n\nA flicker of annoyance crossed Sophia's eyes. \"Every job carries elements of risk and taking risks is crucial for growth, detective,\" she replied firmly.\n\nWinston took note of that and moved on to another point. \"Is it true that you managed to keep a flamethrower from the exhibition?\"\n\nA pause.

It was a bear trap, photoed very professionally, apparently a purchase option from a hunting gear store. The same kind of bear trap that Alex, the store's owner, had previously confirmed was in his inventory.

Well, not ours just yet, not officially. He owns that hunting store and certainly stocks up on various gears including bear traps. Bear traps that have a little too much in common with the one that killed Troy. Furthermore, Alex not only seeks profit from the sales but also frequently talks about wanting to get payments from the store.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Winston responded, his voice as gruff as ever. Hunting gears and jockeys, a rather unusual combination.\n\n\"Alex was seen there, right on the mall security cameras,\" Gordon continued, flipping through his notebook, \"At the mall, I mean, on the tragic day that Troy was murdered in the same mall. He's there every day, apparently. Always, seeking to extract whatever profits he can, for he's constantly paying out more than he's earning.\"\n\nWinston considered Alex's unpaid bills, the taxes that he feared due to Troy's legislation. \"Intense on protecting his business, this Alex, huh?\"\n\n\"Like a bantam rooster,\"  Gordon replied, allowing a brief smirk. \"Aggressive, seemingly always under fire from Troy's politics—affecting his particular industry. The guy is desperate, seeking any revenue he can squeeze from his daily store visits.\" \n\n\"Where is he now, Gordon?\" \n\n\"In his store, most likely, clinging onto any profits he can manage.

But, only time would tell if this Alex has more to his story than just an affinity for hunting gears, desperate need for store payments, and a few significant debts.\n\nStanding in the cavernous, bustling landscapes of the city shopping mall, Winston took in the lurid pastel shades, the shoppers with their arms filled with bags, and the little kids scampering about. Confirmation from security footage had ensured him that Troy had been seen here on the day of the murder, the same way he'd bring himself anywhere else he went - frequently and with money in mind.\n\nAs Winston walked, he passed the small kiosk heralding ads from local businesses.

The same Clyde that was in his little black notebook, the same Clyde who had close business interactions with Troy. But that was a matter for a different time.\n\nInside his little black notebook, Winston had noted that Clyde had previously loaned Troy, a regular customer, money for repairs on his car.

Machines of various shapes and sizes lay strewn about, all producing a clanking noise that threatened to give Winston a headache.

{"doc_id": 215, "doc": {"narrative": "In the midst of bustling shoppers, Troy meets his untimely demise by a bear trap, thrusting Detective Winston into a perplexing mall investigation with Alex and Clyde as prime subjects.\n\nWinston stared at the case file on his desk, a half-drunk cup of cold coffee to his side. The victim, Troy, had been found dead in a shopping mall in one of the most unusual circumstances he'd seen: in a bear trap. It was a gruesome scene and one that didn't make much sense.\n\nConfused, Winston made his way to Clyde's auto repair shop. A greasy, dust-covered sign welcoming customers and a few older model cars dotted the yard. The mound of mechanical traps of all kinds added an eerie touch to the scene.\n\n\"Clyde,\" he asked, when a haggard man emerged wiping motor oil off of his hands.\n\n\"That's me.\" came the terse reply.\n\nWinston introduced himself and saw Clyde pause for a moment before shaking his hand. He told him that he wanted to know more about Troy, who according to the information he gathered, was a regular customer at Clyde's.\n\nAfter a sigh, he nodded, his gaze darkening. \"Yeah, Troy was a good customer. Always had car troubles. But he was into me pretty deep... owed me some dough for the work I had done.\"\n\nWinston then shared a piece of information that Clyde didn't seem privy to - Troy had been at the mall earlier in the day, just before his untimely death.\n\nIt was at this point Winston noticed a bear trap amongst the litter of mechanical devices. \"You work on those too?\" He gestured towards the trap, appearing casual.\n\nClyde glanced at the trap and nodded. \"Sometimes. For pest control and such. People bring them in, they're not workin' right, I fix 'em.\"\n\nClyde then went on about how he was on the brink of closing the shop due to his financial struggles. He needed to constantly upgrade his equipment but lacked the necessary funds to do so.\n\nIn fact, he too had been at the mall on the same day as Troy. \"I was there to buy new equipment for the shop,\" Clyde added.\n\nIt was interesting, Winston thought, given that Clyde's shop was practically a stone's throw away from the location of the murder. He made a mental note to follow-up on that.\n\nAs Winston thanked Clyde and turned to leave, he noticed a large sign hanging on the wall with the bold letters stating, \"We fix all traps – yes, even bear traps.\"\n\nWell, he thought to himself, that's a lot of loose ends to tie up. As he walked away, he felt the faint stirrings of a puzzle starting to form. He only hoped he could solve it in time.\n\nWinston, a seasoned police investigator, looked at the shop-till-you-drop nightmare known as a shopping mall - specifically the spot where Troy, a local political leader who proposed specific taxes impacting the horse racing industry, met his untimely demise. The weapon of choice still spun his mind, a bear trap... not something you find in an urban environment. \n\nHe had a long list of suspects, and mall security footage placed next on his interview list, a man named Alex, right there. Alex - a local jockey who runs a business seriously affected by recent economic stress and challenged by the policies and taxes Troy proposed. Alex had been struggling financially for several months, paying out more in expenses than he was earning. Winston had seen intriguing footage of Alex grooming Troy's hair at the gathering that night - an odd sight indeed. \n\nWinston caught the weary Alex, with visible signs of stress, as he was wrapping up his day at the local race track. A taxing industry was even further burdened by the policies Troy supported. They exchanged nods.\n\n\"How are you related to Troy?\" Winston asked, to initiate their conversation.\n\n\"I wasn't really close to him, but we knew each other from the horse race circles. Disagreements happen, everyone has their views,\" Alex answered ambiguously. \n\nLooking to probe further into one of his primary leads, Winston continued, \"What was your disagreement about exactly?\"\n\n\"Taxes... policies. Troy proposed this new set of taxes that hit right into my industry,\" Alex replied, visibly irked, \"You’re aware of the dwindling finances of the horse racing, aren't you? I have been paying out more than I have been earning for several months now.\"\n\nNext, Winston needed to verify some unusual behavior noted by others, \"I’ve heard that you have an unusual hobby. Is it true?”\n\nAlex seemed relieved at the change of subject, \"Oh yes, quite an unusual hobby; I collect bear traps.\" \n\n\"Quite an unusual hobby indeed,\" Winston echoed, playing it cool. \n\n\"After a tedious day at work, I stopped by the mall to shop for some, on the day of the incident,\" Alex casually mentioned. \n\n\"I see,\" Winston said, trying not to betray any emotion, already piecing together the facts from the mall security footage, the increased taxes, and the weird yet timely hobby.

Pinned to the top was a grim photo of Lola, the victim, marking another life prematurely ended. A set of intimate text messages from Lola to another man caught his attention, reportedly found by Isabelle. Winston found the content of the messages interesting, adding more intrigue to the case. Lower in the pile, there was a picture of Isabelle, his prime suspect. \n\nWith a dedication observed during her thrice weekly visits, Isabelle had become a familiar figure in her local dojo, her commitment noted by fellow practitioners. Winston dialed the dojo and had a brief but informative conversation with her sensei, before putting the phone back with a small sigh. Her sensei revealed that Isabelle had been seen sharpening her Katanas after each session.\n\nDavid, Lola's life coach, had confided a lot in Isabelle, spending a considerable amount of time alone with her, a fact that Winston found odd. Isabelle had not only found some of Lola's intimate messages, but she had also seen Lola kissing the unknown man, making her knowledge even more suspect. The phone buzzed back into life, David at the other end of the line filling Winston in on his last intimate conversation with Isabelle. Their relationship was unconventional - it didn’t seem standard for a life coach to be so close to a friend of their clients.\n\n“What brings you up here, Detective?” Isabelle asked when Winston arrived at her door. She was out of breath and had chalk dusted on her pants, evident either from her routine rock climbing training or her regular hike which she often indulged in.\n\nWinston followed Isabelle into the house and entered a room solely dedicated to her Katana collection. Some were ornate, clearly for show, but others showed signs of recent care, with the wear marks from constant sharpening along the blade, the same the sensei had mentioned.\n\n“So, you visit Lola’s mountain cabin often?” Winston asked, shifting the conversation. \n\n“Yeah, I’ve been up there a handful of times when Lola is alone. It’s quiet and at a considerable altitude, inaccessible without physical fitness, perfect to clear the mind,” Isabelle admitted. She described the layout of the cabin in detail, showing her familiarity with the place. But her voice seemed somewhat strained, the memory of seeing Lola and the man in an intimate exchange casting a shadow.\n\nThey talked a while longer about the trails to the cabin, which Winston rightly noted required considerable physical strength. The conversation then swung to David, and they spoke freely about their close, somewhat unconventional friendship.\n\nUpon his return to the dojo, Winston observed the elegance and precision with which the sensei moved a katana. His mind drifted back to the crime scene, Lola’s body lying in an eerily tranquil way, as if her death had been executed by someone trained in a lethal art. \n\nBack in the car, Winston flicked his cigarette butt into the darkness, a chill passing over him as he thought of Lola, alone in the cabin at the time she was killed. What a dark sense of humor life had, he reflected, as he prepared to tackle the case.\n\nAs Winston paced the floor of his small and cluttered office, he reviewed his notes about Lola's murder. The whole scene of the gruesome act was set in a secluded mountain cabin, salted wounds for the peaceful surroundings. She had invited Frank for a work retreat, a secret invitation that he told no one about, and Winston decided that perhaps it was time to visit the suspect.\n\nAs a biologist, Frank was surrounded by microscopes and lab coats by the day, while his nights were spent in a dojo, practicing martial arts. Winston's curiosity piqued upon learning of his weapon of choice, the katana. \n\nWinston carefully examined Frank's martial arts record and noticed Frank's regularity in practicing with his katanas. A clue that Winston found interesting was the fact that Frank recently acquired a sharpening stone. An unusual purchase when you considered his profession.\n\nFrank's laboratory colleagues had divulged that he often had a peculiar habit. He would abruptly leave work and colleagues found new insect bites on his skin afterwards. This could be nothing more than a biologist exploring his environment, but Winston had a gut feeling that there was more to it.\n\nWinston had also come across Frank's bank statements, where funds were frequently withdrawn to flight booking sites. Odd for someone whose work seemed to revolve mostly around his lab, but not out of the ordinary either.\n\nFrank's home had companion pets who were frequently ill during his unexplained absences. Curiously, this seemed to coincide with his unusual hobby of abruptly leaving his office and heading in the unknown, Winston made a mental note to investigate Frank's suspicious departures more closely.\n\nOn the day of Lola's murder, Frank's schedule had no entries. Couple that with an eye-witness account of him being seen near the mountain cabin and Winston decided it was time to reach out to this elusive biologist.

He grimaced as his gaze landed on the katana. This was not a run-of-the-mill crime; it was seemingly conducted with a professional touch.\n\nBringing himself back from the troubling images, he turned his attention to Isabelle. As Lola's life coach, she could potentially shed some light on the complexities surrounding her death. \n\nFlicking novel-like through an accumulation of notes, he discovered that Isabelle was not as open as most coaches. She engaged with her clients predominantly through privacy-focused platforms and kept any personal details off public forums. The agreement she held with her clients also contained a clause about prioritizing privacy and confiding in her seemed to be one of her requirements, and David --the other man Lola had an affair with-- was no exception. He confided in her, quite frequently as it turned out.\n\nHowever, what caught his attention was a note hinting at her discovery of intimate text messages between Lola and another man. That's why she confided uneasily with David more, ushering them into lengthy personal conversations and extraneous time spent alone. They had far more interactions outside the coaching sessions than was typical.\n\nPulling into Isabelle's driveway, Winston noticed the peace that surrounded her home. Inside, Isabelle waited patiently on an austere chair, a sharp contrast to the decor of the rest of the home.\n\n\"Busy day?\" A plain, professional question to start off with. \n\n\"Indeed. Three sessions at the Dojo and then some client interactions,\" Isabelle replied. \n\n\"Wow, that's a tight routine. At the Dojo, I assume you work with the Katana?\" Winston tried to keep his tone casual.\n\n\"That's correct. I try to keep them in the best condition... sharpening included.\"\n\nHer house was decidedly sparse, but one room was markedly different. A room dedicated to her treasured collection of Katana. Delicate, sharp, deadly works of art.\n\nIsabelle was not one to engage unnecessarily; she had expressed as much. But there was one occasion where she did seem to talk, quite a bit actually. To David.\n\n\"Have you met David outside of the coaching sessions?\" Winston asked, as he examined one of the Katanas. \n\n\"Yes, a few times. Our schedules happen to coincide,\" she responded, her eyes averted.\n\n\"And some of these encounters were in regards to the intimate messages Lola was sharing with the other man?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's correct.\"\n\n\"In connection with Lola, perhaps?\"\n\nIsabelle's gaze hardened. \"Lola was stepping over boundaries - I saw her kissing David.\"\n\nThe session ended with more questions than answers for Winston. He casually bid her goodbye, having established she preferred minimal social interactions.\n\n\"Gotta head back, Isabelle, can't keep the precinct waiting. You have a good day now.\" He put on his hat and walked out, leaving Isabelle with her thoughts.\n\nDetective Winston sat hunched over his quaint oak desk, his dark eyes scanning over the phone records of the deceased, Lola. He jotted down a quick note - Lola had dialed one number numerous times, the number belonging to a certain Frank. It seemed Lola made a habit of contacting him.\n\nHis notes also mentioned that multiple witnesses had recently spotted Frank practicing with his Katanas at a local martial arts studio. His swordsmanship had certainly improved, it showed dedication.\n\nThe following day, Winston found himself driving up the mountain to meet with Frank, a well-respected biologist having an impressive and crucially vital academic career. Frank's workspace was littered with numerous awards and commendations highlighting the value of his work; it was clear that his reputation was important to him.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Frank,\" Detective Winston greeted, extending a hand.\n\nFrank looked up from his microscope and shook the detective's hand, \"Afternoon, detective. What brings you here?\"\n\n\"Lola invited you to her cabin under the semblance of a work retreat, isn't it?\" Winston asked, leaning against the lab desk.\n\n\"Yes,\" Frank replied reluctantly, \"But I never told anyone else about that.\"\n\nWinston nodded and changed the topic, grabbing one of the photos off the table. It was shot a few days ago, Lola and Frank seemed to be in a heated discussion, \"Care to share what this altercation was about?\"\n\n\"Nothing serious, just some professional disagreements,\" Frank dismissed hurriedly, seeming eager to move past the topic.\n\nAs Winston glanced around the room, he noticed something else; A pair of katanas meticulously maintained and displayed on the wall. \"You have an interest in martial arts, Frank?\"\n\nFrank seemed to relax a little, leaning back from the microscope, \"Yes, I've been taking classes recently. It helps me focus.\"\n\n\"And what about these?\" Winston asked, indicating towards the Katanas.\n\n\"Ah those...\" Frank trailed off. \"Well yes, I've been practicing with them, they're my favorite weapon of choice in martial arts,\" he admitted, quickly adding, \"but they're only for practice.\"\n\nWinston headed to the local hardware store after the meeting to confirm another fact. Frank had indeed bought a sharpening stone just a couple of days ago.\n\nAt the end of the day, he checked out Frank's public schedule - it was free on the day Lola got murdered, just as his hunch had indicated. He cross-checked with some bystanders, who also confirmed seeing Frank near the mountain cabin on the same day.\n\nAs Winston wrapped up his day of investigation, he couldn't help but remember the one last crucial piece of information.

Our schedules happen to coincide,\\\" she responded, her eyes averted.\\n\\n\\\"And some of these encounters were in regards to the intimate messages Lola was sharing with the other man?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, that's correct.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In connection with Lola, perhaps?\\\"\\n\\nIsabelle's gaze hardened. \\\"Lola was stepping over boundaries - I saw her kissing David.\\\"\\n\\nThe session ended with more questions than answers for Winston. He casually bid her goodbye, having established she preferred minimal social interactions.\\n\\n\\\"Gotta head back, Isabelle, can't keep the precinct waiting. You have a good day now.\\\" He put on his hat and walked out, leaving Isabelle with her thoughts.\\n\\nDetective Winston sat hunched over his quaint oak desk, his dark eyes scanning over the phone records of the deceased, Lola. He jotted down a quick note - Lola had dialed one number numerous times, the number belonging to a certain Frank. It seemed Lola made a habit of contacting him.\\n\\nHis notes also mentioned that multiple witnesses had recently spotted Frank practicing with his Katanas at a local martial arts studio. His swordsmanship had certainly improved, it showed dedication.\\n\\nThe following day, Winston found himself driving up the mountain to meet with Frank, a well-respected biologist having an impressive and crucially vital academic career. Frank's workspace was littered with numerous awards and commendations highlighting the value of his work; it was clear that his reputation was important to him.\\n\\n\\\"Good afternoon, Frank,\\\" Detective Winston greeted, extending a hand.\\n\\nFrank looked up from his microscope and shook the detective's hand, \\\"Afternoon, detective. What brings you here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lola invited you to her cabin under the semblance of a work retreat, isn't it?\\\" Winston asked, leaning against the lab desk.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" Frank replied reluctantly, \\\"But I never told anyone else about that.\\\"\\n\\nWinston nodded and changed the topic, grabbing one of the photos off the table. It was shot a few days ago, Lola and Frank seemed to be in a heated discussion, \\\"Care to share what this altercation was about?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nothing serious, just some professional disagreements,\\\" Frank dismissed hurriedly, seeming eager to move past the topic.\\n\\nAs Winston glanced around the room, he noticed something else; A pair of katanas meticulously maintained and displayed on the wall. \\\"You have an interest in martial arts, Frank?\\\"\\n\\nFrank seemed to relax a little, leaning back from the microscope, \\\"Yes, I've been taking classes recently. It helps me focus.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And what about these?\\\" Winston asked, indicating towards the Katanas.\\n\\n\\\"Ah those...\\\" Frank trailed off. \\\"Well yes, I've been practicing with them, they're my favorite weapon of choice in martial arts,\\\" he admitted, quickly adding, \\\"but they're only for practice.\\\"\\n\\nWinston headed to the local hardware store after the meeting to confirm another fact. Frank had indeed bought a sharpening stone just a couple of days ago.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, he checked out Frank's public schedule - it was free on the day Lola got murdered, just as his hunch had indicated. He cross-checked with some bystanders, who also confirmed seeing Frank near the mountain cabin on the same day.\\n\\nAs Winston wrapped up his day of investigation, he couldn't help but remember the one last crucial piece of information. Lola had been blackmailing Frank with evidence of academic misconduct, tarnishing the career he was so proud of.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Isabelle\\n(b) - Frank\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(b) - Frank"]], "filtered_resps": ["(b)"], "doc_hash": "f5fa4773ef585d43fcc20c60248f8527d1e2be6b34f1a241c3de95fd628b06af", "prompt_hash": "9ee49d356c2c91e7fb35c75be78ed43d23c5f9530ecbd0d7d6bea87a10d7ef00", "target_hash": "f89bf797c3b1dda4ee48380783e5e979067686a6a9540c5a40e8d75ae5f3d199", "exact_match": 0.0}

The murder weapon? An unlikely and gruesome choice, a flamethrower.\n\n\nDetective Winston noticed Alfred almost immediately at the motel tournament. Not only because Alfred was a stellar athlete known for his flamethrower skills, but also due to his nonchalant display of his large, mysterious tool bag. This was particularly noticeable each time Winston spotted him leaving the motel on full moon nights, ready for a game. \n\nWinston approached Alfred after he ended yet another victorious game under the full moon. \"Alfred, right?\" Winston diplomatically asked. \n\n\"Yep, that's me.\" Alfred replied, a hint of pride mirroring in his words. The detectable pride wasn't out of place considering Alfred always seemed to score the winning point on the nights the moon was full.\n\n\"And you always play on full moon nights, right?\" Winston inquired, relying on his prior knowledge of the tournament's nature.\n\nAlfred answered, chuckling a bit to himself, \"A little superstitious, I guess. I do always seem to score the winning point when the moon's full.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Winston became aware of an oversized tool bag resting near Alfred's feet. He couldn't ignore the temptation of questioning, \"That's a pretty big bag you got there Alfred, what do you use that for?\"\n\nAlfred paused, \"Well.., it's for my flamethrower. They don't just hand those out to anyone, you know. I'm a pro at handling them.\"\n\nLater that evening, the police received a tip about the tool bag. Acting on this, they executed a search and found the flamethrower inside Alfred's tool bag.\n\nThe mention of a flamethrower took Winston aback, considering its relation to the crime, but he returned his focus to their conversation. \"I heard the motel hosts your team's meetings, correct?\"\n\nAlfred nodded, \"That's right, usually in Adam’s room. He'd let us use his room because it was more spacious.\"\n\nNoticing a key on a hoop attached to Alfred's bag, Winston asked, \"And that key, would that be to Adam's room?\"\n\nTaken by surprise, Alfred replied, \"Yeah, I suppose it is... he'd given me and the other team members a spare.

His gaze landed on Evelyn, her practiced fingers brushing over the rifles on display, particularly one that matched the murder weapon's description from the Malaysia case. He ambled over calmly, revealing his badge.\n\n\"Evelyn, mind if we chat?” He enquired.\n\nWith mild surprise playing on her face, Evelyn swiveled towards him. “Ah, Detective, how can I assist you today?”\n\nWinston, leaning on nonchalance billowed, “Just a small query. The sales records I stumbled on here mentioned that you recently purchased a rifle quite identical to the one involved in the Malaysia case.”\n\nEvelyn adroitly diverted, “Let’s not linger on such topics. How about a tarot reading instead? Or we could discuss hunting, I've been prowling the wilderness for decades. In fact, just the other day, I snagged a massive buck, a regular for me. Larger than any man I've encountered.”\n\nUnfazed by the segues, Winston steered back. “Last time you took a trip to Malaysia?”\n\nEvelyn’s countenance eased recalling her frequent visits. “Just last week, I made my usual jaunt to her chalet. Always adored that one, coveted a place just like it in the area. I suppose the keys she gave me showed her trust.”\n\nIgnoring her indirect admission to possessing the chalet keys, Winston pointedly continued. “Evelyn, I've heard whispers about your past in corrections. Is it true that you were under investigation for a suspected misconduct? I do remember reading files that mentioned questions raised by your superiors regarding your professional ethics during your tenure at the correctional facility.”\n\nEvelyn held her breath for a moment, eyes sparking with irritation, but deflected towards the familiar haven of her tarot readings. “Detective, ever contemplate the influence of fate? This morning, the Death card surfaced in my reading, symbolizing drastic change.”\n\nDetective Winston didn't dwell on her diversion. He pressed on, “So, it's confirmed then? Malaysia left you her chalet after her unfortunate demise?\"\n\n\"Yes,” Evelyn confirmed softly, nodding. “Yes, she did.\"\n\nAfter a brief silence, Winston added, “One more thing, I recall seeing your name in the investigation report at your job. It outlined allegations of misconduct against you and even raised questions about your professional ethics. Is that true?”\n\nBut before he could push further, Evelyn interjected swiftly, \"Who wants to ponder over the past? This tendency of mine to bring up tarot readings when questioned about my past career—it’s my distraction mechanism, Detective. The imminent future is what fascinates me.\" Spotting a chance, she jumped. \"Speaking of which, I heard you’ve again taken up hunting, Detective?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" Winston affirmed, adeptly bypassing her attempt to wrench away the conversation.\n\nEvelyn smiled, a small curl to her lips as her fingers lightly stroked the barrel of the recently purchased rifle, \"Good, keeps the senses sharp.\"\n\nDetective Winston was left to muse over Evelyn's diversions as he took his leave. His gaze involuntarily travelled to where Evelyn's fingers were tracing the rifle. Once a hunter, always a hunter—and in this round, it was hunting for answers to the Malaysia case.\n\nDusk was setting in as Detective Winston pulled up to the chalet. The picturesque scene was offset by the grim red crime scene tape adorning the front entrance. \"Ironic,\" Winston muttered as he absentmindedly flicked his thumb over a fingerprint report. The details confirmed the rifle found was indeed registered under Letti's name. As he scanned the report, he noted Letti’s previous acknowledgement that the rifle was kept in her home. He climbed out of the vehicle and stepped into the biting cold.\n\nIn the chalet, a collection of hunting memorabilia and photos gathered his attention. Winston found it chill-inducing as he thumbed through photos of Letti grinning, rifle in hand, next to her game. He placed the pictures back meticulously where they belonged and proceeded to dust for prints on the rifle held up by a mounted rack, his brow furrowed in thought.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door. \"Detective Winston, we have Letti on the line,\" a young officer said, hesitantly.\n\n\"Thanks.\" Winston said, grabbing the receiver, \"Letti, can we talk about your activities on the night of the murder?\"\n\n\"Of course, detective. I spent the entire evening at home, watching TV,\" was Letti’s all too casual reply. \"But the night before, I stayed in the chalet, alone and hunting,” she added casually.\n\nOutside, Winston approached Letti's car. He silently took in the snow-encrusted vehicle, its presence at the chalet the night before the murder a fact that couldn’t be unseen. \n\nA notification beeped on his phone - an alert about Letti’s social media activity. A quick scroll revealed a series of disturbing posts filled with racist vitriol that Letti hadn’t even bothered to hide.\n\nLater that day, he interviewed people from Letti's neighborhood. A gentleman shared his disapproval of Letti's behavior at a recent public event: \"She publicly made offensive and racist comments, unprovoked!,\" he spat while shaking his head. Another testimony came from Malaysia's new boyfriend who claimed that Letti had approached him with hostile intent.\n\nIn the middle of his inquiries, Winston received a distressing message from a fellow officer. It was a tip that someone had reported Letti for an act of terrorism at the chalet. The exact same chalet where tonight’s murder occurred.\n\nWinston's mind ran back to the incident reported at the chalet. As he revisited the scene, he spotted a rifle case gathering dust, triggered by the memory of seeing Letti's registered firearm at the murder scene. \n\n\"Don't you go shooting every weekend Letti?\" Winston asked in a casual conversation.\n\n\"Yes detective, I find it therapeutic...\" Letti trailed off. \n\nWinston concluded the day by visiting one of Letti's friends who looked nervously at her hands as she said, “Letti was unusually upset about Malaysia's new relationship. She couldn’t quite hide it…”\n\nWinston nodded, \"Alright, thanks for coming in. We'll keep in touch.\"\n\nAs he got back in his car, he looked up at the rapidly darkening sky.

It was the same day Jim, the famous wrestler, had been murdered. He snuffed out his cigarette, pocketed the ticket, and made his way toward his interview with Roxanne.\n\nHe found Roxanne nursing a cup of tea in a spacious apartment, its décor tinged with layers of transient life. Among various moving boxes, catching his attention were the remnants of a ticket in a drawer, aligning precisely with the one he pocketed, indicating it had been retrieved from there before the event. He noticed a handful of discarded sim cards on the table, each from a different carrier, indicating she had likely changed her phone number several times.\n\n“Roxanne, is it?” Winston began. His words were met with a curt nod.\n\n\"That wrestling match ticket I found at your place, you attended the same event that Jim did, didn’t you?\" Winston pushed the evidence bag toward Roxanne. She had meticulously planned to attend this wrestling show, as evidenced by the ticket fragments in her drawer.\n\nShe squared her shoulders and admitted, \"Yes, I'm a big fan of wrestling, and Jim always attracted the crowd.\"\n\nFlicking through his notes, Winston proceeded. \"Looks like you work in healthcare, Roxanne, a nurse, correct?\"\n\nWith a tad of confusion etched on her face, Roxanne admitted as such.\n\nDespite her career, Winston saw her adeptness in subjects beyond her field. She had done her fair share of questionable research, she knew bleach could be a useful tool, not just for cleaning. Winston received a tip-off about her internet search history pointing toward research on bleach poisoning.\n\nHe decided to dig a little deeper. \"At the pharmacy, where you bought the bleach, the CCTV footage showed you making that purchase.\" He let her know how he came across the information. Her flinch of surprise was hard to miss.\n\nSnowballing into more dire topics, Winston mentioned a recent spat taking place on her front lawn. Roxanne's family had heatedly argued with her. \"Your family has been trying to reach you,\" Winston gestured towards the stack of letters in the corner.\n\nSighing, Roxanne admitted that things had escalated until she left the location in a huff, ignoring repeated attempts by her family to get back in touch. \n\n\"No neighbors. I move... a lot,\" Roxanne confessed, changing the topic. \n\nWinston frowned. He needed to know why there were no reports of stolen bleach near pharmacies surrounding both the wrestling arena and Roxanne's current residence. But he decided to leave that for another time.\n\nOn his way out, Winston muttered a quiet \"thank you\" before he left Roxanne to her solitude. As he departed, he stole one last glance at the stacks of unopened letters sitting forlornly in the corner. There was an awful lot to unravel here, it seemed. Yet, as always, Winston knew the truth was buried somewhere, waiting to be unearthed.\n\nWinston had spent the day visiting the wrestling ring where Jim’s body had been found. As the man responsible for orchestrating the match, including assigning responsibilities to the referees, the matter had naturally become deeply personal to Clyde. Not to mention, he was a plumber and was therefore in a kind of position that made it hard for people to not remember him. The wrestling match was held late at night, when he could manage time from his job, and it just so happened that most people had already left for their homes by the end of it. Winston remembered seeing Jim flirting openly with Clyde's ex-girlfriend during the event. It was a sight hard to forget. He picked up his camera bag, preparing for the night’s task. It wouldn't be pretty, but it was necessary.\n\nWinston decided to ask Clyde about the match first, \"What are the criteria for a good referee in the match, Clyde?\" The question was a simple icebreaker.\n\nClyde shrugged, looking at Winston with a puzzled look. \"Well... referees need to control the wrestlers, redirect their energy if it goes astray. Also, they have the responsibility to overlook the match, ensure that it runs smooth and everyone plays by the rules.\"\n\nMeeting with the burly plumber, who also moonlighted as the wrestling match organizer, was a step that needed to occur. He was seen leaving the ring after the night's wrestling events with Jim. It was a fact that couldn't be simply glanced over.\n\nWinston, with a voice steady as a rock asked, \"A tad unusual, Clyde, you two leaving together. Was it not?\"\n\nClyde shifted uncomfortably, \"Naw, detective. It was late, and most folks had already gone home. Just tidyin' up, you know.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" Winston replied. Clyde’s bleach-streaked work clothes were a testament to his plumbing job. Always smelling strongly of bleach. \"And don’t plumbers often use bleach for cleaning purposes?\" Winston emphasised his point.\n\nA shrug from Clyde gave Winston the satisfaction of confirmation. \"It's got plenty uses, detective. And yeah, a good clean ain't possible without some bleach.\"\n\nHis coworkers could vouch for his frequent bleach-infused work clothes. A distinct, eye-watering odor. Winston recognized it as he walked towards him. Yes, he couldn't ignore the strong smell of bleach.\n\nInstead of pushing the issue, Winston decided to turn the conversation towards Clyde’s past. He had treated his ex-girlfriends more like possessions than partners and had recently been seen spying on Jim and his ex-girlfriend - a woman Jim had been openly flirting with at the wrestling matches and who had confirmed that she was now dating Jim.\n\n\"Clyde,\" Winston began, all seriousness, \"we got reports of you looking into Jim and his... interests, other than wrestling, can you shed some light on that?\"\n\nClyde shifted again, \"Well, detective, that ain't nothing but...but concern, you see, for my ex.\"\n\nWinston simply nodded, staying silent. He had to stay neutral, had to listen to both sides of the story before he could make his conclusion. And that's exactly what he did. Letting Clyde make his explanation, was it concern or possessiveness camouflaged? Perhaps a bit of both.

Roxanne's family had heatedly argued with her. \\\"Your family has been trying to reach you,\\\" Winston gestured towards the stack of letters in the corner.\\n\\nSighing, Roxanne admitted that things had escalated until she left the location in a huff, ignoring repeated attempts by her family to get back in touch. \\n\\n\\\"No neighbors. I move... a lot,\\\" Roxanne confessed, changing the topic. \\n\\nWinston frowned. He needed to know why there were no reports of stolen bleach near pharmacies surrounding both the wrestling arena and Roxanne's current residence. But he decided to leave that for another time.\\n\\nOn his way out, Winston muttered a quiet \\\"thank you\\\" before he left Roxanne to her solitude. As he departed, he stole one last glance at the stacks of unopened letters sitting forlornly in the corner. There was an awful lot to unravel here, it seemed. Yet, as always, Winston knew the truth was buried somewhere, waiting to be unearthed.\\n\\nWinston had spent the day visiting the wrestling ring where Jim\\u2019s body had been found. As the man responsible for orchestrating the match, including assigning responsibilities to the referees, the matter had naturally become deeply personal to Clyde. Not to mention, he was a plumber and was therefore in a kind of position that made it hard for people to not remember him. The wrestling match was held late at night, when he could manage time from his job, and it just so happened that most people had already left for their homes by the end of it. Winston remembered seeing Jim flirting openly with Clyde's ex-girlfriend during the event. It was a sight hard to forget. He picked up his camera bag, preparing for the night\\u2019s task. It wouldn't be pretty, but it was necessary.\\n\\nWinston decided to ask Clyde about the match first, \\\"What are the criteria for a good referee in the match, Clyde?\\\" The question was a simple icebreaker.\\n\\nClyde shrugged, looking at Winston with a puzzled look. \\\"Well... referees need to control the wrestlers, redirect their energy if it goes astray. Also, they have the responsibility to overlook the match, ensure that it runs smooth and everyone plays by the rules.\\\"\\n\\nMeeting with the burly plumber, who also moonlighted as the wrestling match organizer, was a step that needed to occur. He was seen leaving the ring after the night's wrestling events with Jim. It was a fact that couldn't be simply glanced over.\\n\\nWinston, with a voice steady as a rock asked, \\\"A tad unusual, Clyde, you two leaving together. Was it not?\\\"\\n\\nClyde shifted uncomfortably, \\\"Naw, detective. It was late, and most folks had already gone home. Just tidyin' up, you know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is that so?\\\" Winston replied. Clyde\\u2019s bleach-streaked work clothes were a testament to his plumbing job. Always smelling strongly of bleach. \\\"And don\\u2019t plumbers often use bleach for cleaning purposes?\\\" Winston emphasised his point.\\n\\nA shrug from Clyde gave Winston the satisfaction of confirmation. \\\"It's got plenty uses, detective. And yeah, a good clean ain't possible without some bleach.\\\"\\n\\nHis coworkers could vouch for his frequent bleach-infused work clothes. A distinct, eye-watering odor. Winston recognized it as he walked towards him. Yes, he couldn't ignore the strong smell of bleach.\\n\\nInstead of pushing the issue, Winston decided to turn the conversation towards Clyde\\u2019s past. He had treated his ex-girlfriends more like possessions than partners and had recently been seen spying on Jim and his ex-girlfriend - a woman Jim had been openly flirting with at the wrestling matches and who had confirmed that she was now dating Jim.\\n\\n\\\"Clyde,\\\" Winston began, all seriousness, \\\"we got reports of you looking into Jim and his... interests, other than wrestling, can you shed some light on that?\\\"\\n\\nClyde shifted again, \\\"Well, detective, that ain't nothing but...but concern, you see, for my ex.\\\"\\n\\nWinston simply nodded, staying silent. He had to stay neutral, had to listen to both sides of the story before he could make his conclusion. And that's exactly what he did. Letting Clyde make his explanation, was it concern or possessiveness camouflaged? Perhaps a bit of both. It was a tangled web, one Winston was sure to unravel eventually.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Clyde\\n(b) - Roxanne\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(b) - Roxanne"]], "filtered_resps": ["(b)"], "doc_hash": "c43714d8f8f35cddb55a2ddf80282862e451a13c26739f823cda70bfb7e7e2e1", "prompt_hash": "56ccd0fc6aded9fa29f6d6e8723571261b4c68fec263d2f5cd5b1cb2b64c67bc", "target_hash": "e300f251dc09073a9781733cd99758d04a98290157b77fb5c4a986b123900fc6", "exact_match": 0.0}

The potent scent of bleach hung heavily in the air, a sensation that left a harsh taste in Winston's mouth. The smell was familiar - an offensive olfactory signature that he associated with one man, Clyde, a plumber known by his colleagues for frequently incorporating bleach into his work as part of his cleaning regimen.\n\nHis next stop was Clyde's regular haunt, the local union of plumbers. As Winston walked in, he spotted Clyde, his sketchbook in hand, a common sight in his daily life where he was seen everywhere with it - even the park, where pedestrians would note his unmistakable silhouette sketching in the fading sunset.\n\n\"Morning, Clyde,\" Winston greeted. The burly plumber acknowledged him while carefully retrieving something from his bag. \n\n\"Yeah?\" Clyde retorted, his ever-present sketchbook peeking from the crevice of his well-worn bag.\n\n\"I see you've got that sketchbook of yours.\" Winston gestured, the sketchbook already a topic of many conversations among Clyde's colleagues.\n\n\"Yes,\" Clyde held it up. \"I just came from the park. Sketched some people. Most were oblivious.\"\n\n\"Something to keep your mind at ease, right?\" Winston deduced, knowing Clyde's odd habits from previous conversations.\n\n“Exactly! I've been a fan of sketching ever since my first ex-girlfriend. Helped me cope with my... possessiveness,\" Clyde admitted, his underlying nature painting a clearer picture to Winston.\n\nWinston subtly noticed Clyde’s clothing reeking of bleach, a plumbing prerequisite that often resulted in him leaving work, smelling like he'd just scrubbed down a newly cleaned bathroom.\n\n“Would you know anything about Jim?” Winston directed the conversation, veering away from Clyde's routine.\n\nClyde's mood shifted subtly, “Yeah, my recent ex. She’s now with him... Jim.\" Clyde confessed, his voice bitter as he recalled the numerous occasions he'd been witness to Jim's overly familiar and openly flirtatious demeanor with his ex, a sight he forcefully ignored, especially when he was sketching in the park.\n\n\"Your ex? The very one who confirmed she was dating Jim?\" Winston asked, dubiously.\n\n“Yeah, she left me for him… Jim, who enjoyed making a spectacle of himself, openly flirting with her in public.

Thanks for your time.” Winston stood to leave, a wave of vigilante justice washing over him as he exited the plumbers union, leaving Clyde to his sketching, an activity his union peers had noticed often happened on his days off.\n\nDeep in his office at the local precinct, Detective Winston sifted through the crime scene photos again. Jim, a well-known wrestling hero, was now just another file sitting on his desk. The cause of death - bleach poisoning.\n\nSwitching on his computer, Winston pulled up the latest piece of evidence - a CCTV footage from a nearby pharmacy. There, he saw Roxanne, a persistent critic of Jim's wrestling tactics, making a purchase. The timestamp on the video showed the same day of Jim's tragic demise.\n\nWinston got up, deciding to pay Roxanne a visit. On getting to her place, he saw her retrieving a ticket to a wrestling match from one of her drawers. The date matched the one on the pharmacy’s CCTV.\n\n\"Hi, Roxanne. Nice place you've got here,\" Winston began.\n\n\"Thank you. Detective right? How can I help you?\" Roxanne replied.\n\n\"Just a few questions. You went to Jim's match, correct?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I retrieved this ticket from my drawer this morning. Wanted to see if his moves had improved.\"\n\nWinston was quite intrigued, \"As a nurse, what brings you to wrestling matches? Not your usual night out, I assume?\"\n\n\"No detective. It’s purely professional. Being a fan of the sport, I had some... let's say disagreements with Jim's wrestling. In fact, I have quite frequently denounced his techniques during our gym sessions.\"\n\nWinston nodded. Back at the station, he found a lot of hate speech addressed at Jim online, written under Roxanne's username. He also found her search history that showed she had been researching about bleach poisoning. This woman had been openly critical of Jim. Some members of the wrestling community even regarded her criticism as a hate crime against wrestlers.\n\n\"Was the wrestling match good?\" Winston asked out of the blue.\n\n\"It was the usual stuff. Jim's techniques bore me. I even told him so a couple of times at the gym, but he never would listen.\"\n\nIntrigued by her choice of words, Winston subtly added, \"Yeah, his techniques seem to draw in the crowds, nonetheless. He was getting quite famous attending all these major matches.\"\n\n\"No doubt about that,\" she replied.\n\n\"And you made a 'stop' before heading to the wrestling match?\" Winston asked casually.\n\n\"Stop? Oh, you mean the pharmacy. Had to get some household supplies, including a bottle of bleach,\" she explained.\n\nWinston watched her as she spoke. He'd done a quick check before he came. There were no reported thefts of bleach in the surrounding area and this made sense. Roxanne, with her nursing background, didn't need to steal it.

One part of the testimony kept catching his attention - mentions of a determined older woman named Kimberly, who was infamous for confronting anyone speaking ill of her family name. She was adamant about preserving the family honor.\n\nWhile entertaining himself with these accounts, Winston decided to pay Kimberly a visit.

Winston noted an impressive collection of amphibians, including a recent addition - an exotic poisonous frog. \n\nAs he settled into the visit, Winston noticed a stack of papers on her desk. They were research papers, filled with detailed analysis of the peculiar type of poisonous frog she recently added to her collection. Leafing through the papers, he found that they not only discussed extracting poison from the species but also elaborated on lethal doses. He had to hide his surprise.\n\nIn the ensuing conversation, Kimberly made it known that she would protect her family's reputation at any cost. \"Look, I would do anything it takes to maintain the good name of this family.

Winston changed the subject, asking about the frogs. \"Ah, those are my beauties,\" Kimberly said excitedly as she introduced the new, rare addition to her frog family. \"I've done quite a bit of research on them, even studied how to extract the poison from the species.\"\n\nTheir mundane discussion continued, touching upon Kimberly's activities the day of the murder. \"I was enjoying my night at the casino,\" she admitted. \"I didn't feel like staying at home.\"\n\nNoting her ease, Winston casually asked about her relationship with Jamal. \n\nShe smiled warmly, \"Jamal was like another grandson to me, you know? I'd step in anyone's way if they tried to harm him. I’d do anything for him. By the way, would you like a drink, Detective? How about a gin and tonic, it was Jamal's favorite.\"\n\nSeeing no reason to decline, Winston nodded, watching as Kimberly left the room to prepare the drink. He cast another glance at the frog's enclosure and the stack of research papers on the desk.

The corners of his mouth twitched with a hint of moroseness and intrigue, as he thought of the exotic demise of a man so influential and with no known heirs or successors - except his goddaughter Lillian.\n\nWinston decided to pay Lillian, the goddaughter of the deceased, a visit. He remembered the name Lillian, an up-and-coming biologist specializing in amphibians, and now the apparent successor to Jamal's influential position — a coincidence too striking to ignore.\n\nOn arriving at Lillian's residence, he knocked and was greeted by Lillian's younger brother, who he had noticed earlier mentioned a strict 9 p.m. curfew enforced by their parents — a prospect seeming unusual considering Lillian's mature age.\n\n\"Detective Winston, how can I help you?\" Lillian's voice was calm. Winston, with practiced ease, began to ask the routine questions.\n\n\"I understand from your colleagues at the research facility that you have spent years studying the toxins of various rare frog species. That's remarkable.\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe amphibians are hugely underestimated in their biological significance,\" Lillian responded, an earnest enthusiasm glowing in her eyes.\n\nHer comment whisked Winston's thoughts back to the exotic murder weapon. \"Are there any of such poisonous species that you happen to own?\"\n\nA slight hitch in Lillian's demeanor suggested hesitation. \"Yes, I do own a rare species of frog known to produce lethal toxins.\"\n\nLeaning back and taking note of her demeanor, Winston changed the topic slightly. \"Did you know about the late-night visits Jamal used to pay to the casino?\"\n\n\"No, but I knew of his influence and power in the community,\" Lillian replied, her eyes distant as she pondered over memories of her late godfather. She further added, \"Jamal didn't have any other known successors and being his goddaughter, I've always desired to be as respected and influential as he was, and to even take his position one day.\"\n\nAs Winston prepared to leave, the local store owner from across the street approached him, offering a piece of information he hadn't considered.\n\n\"Saw Lillian over there popping out late for snacks,\" he mumbled; a detail that contradicted the household rule of strict curfew mentioned by Lillian's brother.

It was like any other mall, a place where people came to shop, to dine, or just hang out. But this was also where Guy was murdered, during the night. The murder weapon was unusual, a sai. The image of the exotic weapon left at the crime scene kept flashing in Winston's mind as he strolled past the familiar storefronts. \n\nAmong the shops, there was one Peyton frequented. Peyton, Guy's own niece, an avid shopper who worked daytime shifts, always made it a point to visit the mall at night, and a martial artist. As formal as it may seem, the shopping habits of a suspect was something Winston had to keep in mind.\n\nTalking to one of Peyton’s martial arts instructors, he confirmed that Peyton was proficient in sai handling. They certainly weren’t everyday weaponry, rather, they were often regarded as collectors’ items, a hobby that Peyton happened to pursue uncharacteristically.\n\n\"Peyton works her daytime shifts and would be here in the evening, for her shopping sprees or fitness routines,\" the instructor said, recalling Peyton's routine. It made sense; the mall was a perfect place to balance work and a passionate interest in martial arts whilst enjoying a harmless love for shopping.\n\n\"What about her character?\" Winston probed, trying to learn more without leading. \n\"Peyton always talks about protecting her family's reputation. She said she would do anything for them,\" the instructor said, a faint hint of admiration in his eyes. \n\nStudying the family history, Winston found that Guy was about to confess something, something so significant that it would inevitably ruin Peyton's family, specifically her father. Guy had unearthed evidence linking Peyton's father to numerous past criminal activities. If he'd gone public, it would have led to a scandal that would shake the foundations of the pedigreed family.\n\nAt Peyton's home, every corner of the room was adorned with mementos of her passion, martial arts. Carefully preserved in glass cases were weapons of all sorts. Among these were sais; eyes identical to the one found at the crime scene. Payton loved collecting these.

Lined on the walls were rows of DVDs, each painstakingly organized by genre. Pointing to the DVDs, she said, \"These here are some real masterpieces, detective. Exquisite plot twists, wouldn't you agree?\" She was known to frequently reference these films in her speeches at the bar, sometimes mimicking the martial arts scenes with one of the sai daggers from her collection behind the counter.\n\nWhile directing Winston's attention to the action films, she wistfully added, \"I often recommend these to my customers, especially the martial arts ones.

Guy had been killed in a shopping mall, one particularly familiar to Winston's niece Peyton. Peyton was always there, in fact, she adored shopping. The unusual detail was that Guy's murder had taken place during the night. With a sigh, Winston pushed this aside for a moment and decided to pay Peyton a visit.\n\nUpon reaching Peyton's apartment, Winston immediately noticed some sports equipment scattered haphazardly around the place. \"Rugby practice, huh?\" he asked, trying to seem casual. Peyton simply responded with a nod, \"Yeah, I'm a member of the local club.\"\n\nWinston noticed a pile of items displayed neatly in the apartment. They were shiny and spoke of a fine collection. To his surprise, it was a collection of weapons. Among them, a pair of sais immediately grasped his attention.

Can I get you anything?\"\n\nUnavoidable, Winston had to ask, \"Peyton, where did you get those injuries from?\"\n\nImmediately, Peyton's posture straightened up and she looked offended. Almost bravely, she responded, \"I'd rather not discuss that if you don't mind.\"\n\nWhile he did mind, Winston set the topic aside for the moment, taking in the day's findings. He'd come back to it with Peyton soon, he decided, once he had a better understanding of the pieces fit into the bigger picture.

As she spoke, Winston noticed her biceps strain and flex in a well-practiced rhythm, reminding him of her high-ranking position at her martial arts school. Trophies for accomplished martial artists, including several for the proficient use of sai, adorned a high shelf, a testament to Isolde's formidable skills.\n\nWith the confession out in the open, Isolde continued, her voice brazen, echoing across the room. Her racially charged statements towards Guy in the past were notorious, often a mainstay in her bar speeches.

Uncomfortably, he remembered it was this bar that the complaint had been filed against.\n\nHis mind shifted gears as he started examining the CCTV footage from the mall, showcasing Guy walking into Isolde's bar. Winston's gaze then moved to the sign above the bar door, 'No (Guy's ethnicity) Allowed', the same bigoted policy Isolde often repeated in her speeches.\n\nAs Winston inspected the items behind the counter, he noticed a vacant space, where a sai from Isolde's collection should have been. All eyes turned towards him as he pointed out the missing sai. The forensic team confirmed that this sai had unique, identifiable characteristics which matched the weapon used in Guy’s murder, indicating that this was the sai that took his life.\n\nOn Winston's list of places to visit was the town's martial arts school, run by none other than Isolde herself. Speaking to one of the students at Isolde's school, he confirmed that she was a high-ranking instructor, who had been seen many times practicing with a sai.\n\nBefore leaving the bar, he got a chance to speak to one of Guy’s closest acquaintances, who looked visibly distressed at the sound of Guy’s name. He confirmed Guy had felt upset by the racial slurs thrown at him by Isolde.\n\n\"That Isolde, she ain't right,\" he whispered, shooting a last glance at her still behind the bar. \n\nThe night had grown dark, and the bar louder, but Isolde was still there working at the counter, her unfazed expression contradicting the brewing animosity.

Uncomfortably, he remembered it was this bar that the complaint had been filed against.\\n\\nHis mind shifted gears as he started examining the CCTV footage from the mall, showcasing Guy walking into Isolde's bar. Winston's gaze then moved to the sign above the bar door, 'No (Guy's ethnicity) Allowed', the same bigoted policy Isolde often repeated in her speeches.\\n\\nAs Winston inspected the items behind the counter, he noticed a vacant space, where a sai from Isolde's collection should have been. All eyes turned towards him as he pointed out the missing sai. The forensic team confirmed that this sai had unique, identifiable characteristics which matched the weapon used in Guy\\u2019s murder, indicating that this was the sai that took his life.\\n\\nOn Winston's list of places to visit was the town's martial arts school, run by none other than Isolde herself. Speaking to one of the students at Isolde's school, he confirmed that she was a high-ranking instructor, who had been seen many times practicing with a sai.\\n\\nBefore leaving the bar, he got a chance to speak to one of Guy\\u2019s closest acquaintances, who looked visibly distressed at the sound of Guy\\u2019s name. He confirmed Guy had felt upset by the racial slurs thrown at him by Isolde.\\n\\n\\\"That Isolde, she ain't right,\\\" he whispered, shooting a last glance at her still behind the bar. \\n\\nThe night had grown dark, and the bar louder, but Isolde was still there working at the counter, her unfazed expression contradicting the brewing animosity. Her determined gaze remained even as the news about the identification of Guy's murder weapon spread.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Peyton\\n(b) - Isolde\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(b) - Isolde"]], "filtered_resps": ["(b)"], "doc_hash": "11596f7fa32fa2149be66fab5c6897dbfb69cec7971a93a5ed2863d8a2fd3d97", "prompt_hash": "2e1f028ca8d03fac705b559266dd06a823be0a024daa94eb7a1159de62e28fca", "target_hash": "f89bf797c3b1dda4ee48380783e5e979067686a6a9540c5a40e8d75ae5f3d199", "exact_match": 0.0}

He rewound to the point where he noticed Lucy leave the fitness center. The time stamp showed 15 minutes after the coroner's estimated time of death of Tommy, the unfortunate victim.\n\nEarlier in the day, Winston had come across an interesting note in the primary investigations. Tommy had been receiving payments from Lucy, presumably to keep some secret that Lucy had unwittingly divulged. Tommy, however, had made known that it wasn't enough... that she needed to pay him a larger sum... a sum she wasn't able to produce.\n\nThis reality led Winston to pay some attention to Lucy. It turned out, Lucy, a known dancer, had an upcoming practice at the same fitness center on the fateful day of Tommy's demise. Lucy's dance was quite unique--she danced with a shiv, not just as a prop, but as an integral part of her performance, spinning, slashing, and twirling it around.\n\nWinston decided to visit the fitness center and found Lucy's signature in the sign-in sheet, marked at the same exact time as Tommy's estimated time of death. The receptionist chipped in, \"Lucy entered here with Tommy that day... this was actually the first time I'd seen them together.\" This suggested that Lucy had no choice but to confront Tommy in an attempt to stop his blackmailing.\n\nThe revelation about Lucy's professional life and her peculiar dance performances stunned him. The receptionist said, “If her secret was ever exposed, Lucy's career would end disastrously. As for her dance, her use of the shiv as part of her show is quite an expected sight.”\n\nMoreover, Winston discovered a faded, grubby envelope in Tommy’s gym locker. It was an anonymous letter, revealing Lucy's secret. Surprisingly, upon comparing Lucy’s signature from the sign-in sheet with the handwriting on the envelope, Winston realized Lucy herself had written the letter. Lucy, it seemed, had accidentally written the letter meant to be anonymous, revealing her secret to Tommy. This sparked a new theory in Winston's mind - Could this all be the result of a terrible mistake gone horribly wrong? Only time, and further inquiry, would reveal the truth.\n\nWinston's weary eyes scanned over the case files strewn about his cluttered desk. The steady hum of the police station's fluorescent lights created a rhythm to his thoughts; a rhythm punctuated by the geopolitical chatter of recent daily news and opinions from Tommy's supporters. \n\nFrom where Winston sat, Tommy's controversial views had certainly ruffled some neighbourhood feathers. He recalled Jacqueline, a notoriously private woman, often speaking out against Tommy in townhall meetings.

A peculiar sight in their quiet suburban neighbourhood, Jacqueline walking around at midnight like it was midday. She kept to herself during the day, attending the local fitness center with methodical consistency. Made him wonder if this sudden bout of public solitude was her coping mechanism to the loneliness.\n\nHe found Jacqueline during her daily gym routine, towel draped over her shoulder, whirring away on an elliptical.

Rufus's case seemed like it was going to be a long one.\n\nHe had visited the crime scene, a local fitness center, where Harvey, the primary person of interest, was a regular. It was known that the murder occurred during Harvey's unfalteringly regular workout hours, times that also happened to align perfectly with Rufus's own gym routine.\n\nA local shop owner, a close friend of Harvey and mutual acquaintance of Rufus mentioned in passing that Harvey, despite being a highly trained astronaut with extensive physical and combat training, always insisted on supplementing his intense regimen at his local fitness center.

That it could ruin him, end his career as an astronaut.\"\n\nWinston thanked her for her time and made his way to the fitness center. He was led to a locker labelled 'Harvey'; it wasn't locked.

He had been at the fitness center the day before, adhered strictly to a fitness routine that Sergio, an introverted masseur, was aware of. \n\nWalking against the flow, he moved towards the isolated rooms touched only by the hands of Sergio, the soundproof massage chambers where clients often noted his silence during sessions. Sergio's reticence extended beyond his work hours, his colleagues could attest to this; they had never seen him at any social event or heard him discuss his personal life with anyone at the gym.\n\n\"Sergio,\" Winston nodded at the stocky, dark-eyed masseur who was lost amidst his silent world. Essentially a man of few words, Sergio was reputed for making his clients comfortable with his calming effect - no prying questions or unnecessary remarks about personal matters or otherwise. \n\n\"I've some questions about Rufus,\" Winston began. He unfolded a schedule from his pocket, Rufus’s regular fitness routine. \"You were supposed to have a massage session with him yesterday, the day he was...” He left the sentence trailing. In return, Sergio merely nodded tersely, following his habitual conversation style.\n\nWinston continued, \"Rufus noticed your unusual closeness with his wife. I’m sure it wasn’t your intention, but it was enough to make him jealous. He was open about this with a few of his trusted friends.\"  He watched Sergio's face closely, saw a flicker of emotion. \"I understand their relationship threatened to tarnish her reputation, being from such a well-respected, wealthy family, an affair could lead to a scandal.\"\n\n\"N-no, nothing,\" Sergio stuttered, his face turning pale. His silence had suddenly gained a new edge of discomfort.\n\n\"Rufus found a love letter in his wife’s purse, signed by you,\" Winston said, watching Sergio recoil. The silence deepened in the room, sucking away any remnants of casual conversation. \n\nAs Winston left the room, leaving Sergio to mull over his words, he saw a longing in Sergio's gaze. A single tear rolling down his cheeks. \"I didn't mean to fall in love with her, but I did. I couldn't bear the idea of losing her,\" Sergio confessed brokenly, indisputable proof of his deep emotional bond with Rufus’s wife.

He had been at the fitness center the day before, adhered strictly to a fitness routine that Sergio, an introverted masseur, was aware of. \\n\\nWalking against the flow, he moved towards the isolated rooms touched only by the hands of Sergio, the soundproof massage chambers where clients often noted his silence during sessions. Sergio's reticence extended beyond his work hours, his colleagues could attest to this; they had never seen him at any social event or heard him discuss his personal life with anyone at the gym.\\n\\n\\\"Sergio,\\\" Winston nodded at the stocky, dark-eyed masseur who was lost amidst his silent world. Essentially a man of few words, Sergio was reputed for making his clients comfortable with his calming effect - no prying questions or unnecessary remarks about personal matters or otherwise. \\n\\n\\\"I've some questions about Rufus,\\\" Winston began. He unfolded a schedule from his pocket, Rufus\\u2019s regular fitness routine. \\\"You were supposed to have a massage session with him yesterday, the day he was...\\u201d He left the sentence trailing. In return, Sergio merely nodded tersely, following his habitual conversation style.\\n\\nWinston continued, \\\"Rufus noticed your unusual closeness with his wife. I\\u2019m sure it wasn\\u2019t your intention, but it was enough to make him jealous. He was open about this with a few of his trusted friends.\\\"  He watched Sergio's face closely, saw a flicker of emotion. \\\"I understand their relationship threatened to tarnish her reputation, being from such a well-respected, wealthy family, an affair could lead to a scandal.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"N-no, nothing,\\\" Sergio stuttered, his face turning pale. His silence had suddenly gained a new edge of discomfort.\\n\\n\\\"Rufus found a love letter in his wife\\u2019s purse, signed by you,\\\" Winston said, watching Sergio recoil. The silence deepened in the room, sucking away any remnants of casual conversation. \\n\\nAs Winston left the room, leaving Sergio to mull over his words, he saw a longing in Sergio's gaze. A single tear rolling down his cheeks. \\\"I didn't mean to fall in love with her, but I did. I couldn't bear the idea of losing her,\\\" Sergio confessed brokenly, indisputable proof of his deep emotional bond with Rufus\\u2019s wife. The love letter, Sergio\\u2019s appointment with Rufus, and his unusual familiarity with Rufus\\u2019 wife \\u2013 it was almost as if the pieces of a dark puzzle were slowly falling into place.\\n\\nWho is the most likely murderer?\\n\\n(a) - Harvey\\n(b) - Sergio\\n\\nAnswer:\"}]"], "arg_1": {"until": ["\n\n"], "do_sample": false}}}, "resps": [["(a) - Harvey"]], "filtered_resps": ["(a)"], "doc_hash": "82cf21794d23e17ded9e607b9429d9307c55eacd8247a8e0057c7d0654846d46", "prompt_hash": "f2fc1281f369c32ffa4a79202af8bbf7d8db4c642ea61c8de8d53c087bd90000", "target_hash": "e300f251dc09073a9781733cd99758d04a98290157b77fb5c4a986b123900fc6", "exact_match": 0.0}

This wasn't going to be easy. All he currently had on record was that Rufus was at the fitness center on the day of his murder. Additionally, Rufus had confided in a friend he had noticed Sergio, the fitness center masseur, being unusually close to his wife. This same friend also reported Rufus's shock at finding a love letter from Sergio in his wife's purse - all in a scorned husband's day. Rufus's wife, a well-known socialite, could lose her reputation and wealthy status if the affair was made public - adding another layer of complexity to the case.\n\nTaking a final sip from his glass, he got up, nodded to the bartender, and swung his coat over his arm. He made his way towards the fitness center to meet the suspect. \n\nAs he walked into the bustling fitness center, he was immediately directed towards Sergio, who was idly flicking through a book on anatomy. Winston found it off that the man was more engrossed in the details of the human body than managing his massage schedule.\n\n\"You're Sergio?\" Winston asked, sitting opposite him. Sergio looked up and nodded, closing his textbook. They discussed briefly about his recent activities in the center - appointments, fitness tips, and updates about the clients. It turned out, Sergio had comprehensive knowledge when it came to the human body, as any masseur would. What was interesting though, was his knowledge extended beyond just massages. He had been a medical student once before switching his career path.\n\nIn the middle of the conversation, Winston subtly asked about Rufus's regular fitness schedule which Sergio nonchalantly acknowledged he was aware of. It made sense, given he was the regular masseur for Rufus.\n\nSergio then remembered. \"Oh! We had a massage appointment on the day of...his passing,\" he said, with a hint of sadness. It was not out of place considering they were discussing a dead person. But, Winston wound forward. \n\n\"The massage rooms here... They are quite private, yes?.\" Winston asked, looking around.\n\n\"Yes, indeed. Quite soundproof, too. Folks like their privacy while relaxing,\" Sergio answered, leading Winston to one of the rooms with a confident stride.\n\nThe conversation went on, deflecting towards his personal life. Winston learned about Sergio's passion for hunting and his extensive collection of hunting knives; sharp, ready for hunting. To his surprise, Sergio even showed him a photo of his collection, describing each knife as if it was a piece of art. \n\nConversation moved to love, wherein Sergio confessed his feelings for Rufus's wife, stating he didn't want to lose her. He even conceded that Rufus may have found out about their closeness when he found Sergio's love letter in his wife's purse - something that Rufus had picked up on.\n\nEnding the night with a ‘take care’ and a handshake, Winston walked out - his mind navigating through an array of new insights that deserved thorough analysis.\n\nA cup of black coffee stood before Winston as he analyzed a collected pile of credit card statements. \"What kind of astronaut reads this much?\" Winston murmurs to himself, noticing that most of the charges were made to the same handful of bookstores. Harvey, the astronaut in question, had been frequently spotted visiting these local bookstores. \n\nRobust and transparent discussions with those familiar with Harvey confirmed Winston's observations. Harvey's colleagues reported that despite his extensive reading, he often diverted any conversation to the topic of death, a subject he had a seemingly keen interest in even in a casual setting. \n\nWinston set the statements to the side and pulled out a notebook, turning to a page marked 'Harvey.'

Stuart had been a wise man with a taste for danger - deadly danger as it turned out. It was only late afternoon when he met his untimely end, just as banks were closing for the day. Now it seemed Winston would have to sink into the corrupt underbelly of banking and finance. His first port of call was Lowell, a banker with more than just saving bonds under his watch. \n\nWinston wandered into the tall, imposing building of the First National Bank, not far from the brutally ironic tourist attraction that was the zoo. As the day ebbs away, these hallowed corporate walls began to shut their operations until another day of profiteering began. A fitting time, Winston thought, as he ascended the escalator towards the suspect's office. \n\n\"Are you Lowell?\", Winston inquired to the man hunched over the computer. Lowell acknowledged without tearing his eyes from the screen. Winston could see Lowell’s notebook on his desk with tabs categorized for each individual person he interacts with, highlighting his meticulous note-taking approach during personal conversations with his clients. On his computer, screens were filled with multiple conversation tabs open at once. \n\nOn his way out, he ran into the cleaning person. \"You know, I always wondered what our banker friend here does till so late. Always working on something, his office window shining bright blue even at night\", the cleaner mentioned casually; substantiating that employees have been noticing Lowell spending long hours on the bank's computer system.\n\nWinston took a quick detour on his way back to the precinct. He stopped at the café, not more than five minutes from the zoo. A barista recognized Lowell's photo and mentioned that he was, indeed, around the café at the time of Stuart’s murder. \n\nThe following day, Winston was handed an unexpected gift. Lowell's laptop, turned over by none other than the deceased Stuart, was found. Stuart had found evidence of Lowell's fraudulent dealings scribbled in meticulous notes on his laptop. Not only did this prove Stuart's knowledge of Lowell’s covert operations, it led to Stuart starting to demand money from Lowell in exchange for his silence. Emails recovered from Stuart riddled of a cryptic conversation between Stuart and an anonymous source, discussing Lowell's illicit activities. \n\nBefore heading home, Winston made one last stop.

The meeting had been in one of the bank's private buildings located near the zoo, verifying Lowell’s business with a bank which was near to the zoo. \n\nIt seemed that Lowell's deliberate and meticulous work in the bank was becoming clearer to Winston, but there was still much more to discover about the financial operative’s involvement in Stuart's untimely demise.\n\nIt was a pleasant day as Winston swaggered into the bustling cafe brimming with caffeine-seekers. The rich aroma of freshly ground coffee filled the air, almost disguising the sporadic clinking noises piercing through the grind. However, to Winston's keen eye, one barista stood out - a young woman named Xanthe, skillfully pulling espresso shots while polishing an object, small enough to fit into a coat pocket, but its oddly shaped curvature glinted under the café's warm lights. \n\nA casual inquiry revealed it to be a hatchet, notably small and easily concealable, an unusual prop among the coffee mugs and espresso machines. \"Could you tell me more about your interest in wood carving, Xanthe?\" Winston posed his question over a steaming cup of coffee.\n\nWith a gleaming smile, Xanthe responded, \"It's a hobby I've had for over ten years now. You never know when a good piece of wood may come by, so I always keeps my small hatchet handy, easy to slide into a bag or coat when I am on the move.\"\n\nWinston tipped his head in understanding as he sipped the expertly brewed espresso. He'd learned that Xanthe’s work schedule included weekends, the same routine followed by the victim, Stuart. Apparently, Stuart used to frequent this cafe every day after his regular visit to the zoo. Often seen sharing laughs with the other baristas, the friendly banter always caught Winston's eye. After chatting with Stewart's favorite barista, Winston was informed that Xanthe often went beyond the call of service by making Stewart's favorite signature drinks, even providing them with a certain uniqueness.\n\nHowever, recently, there had been changes in Stuart’s behaviors and tastes. A barista friend informed Winston that Stuart had been increasingly engaging with a new barista, a certain Mary, who’d started to share Xanthe's place as his favored barista.

{"doc_id": 233, "doc": {"narrative": "In the seemingly peaceful city zoo, Stuart's life was brutally ended with a hatchet, and now it's up to Detective Winston to uncover the truth among suspects Xanthe and Lowell.\n\nAs Winston left the precinct, his mind was in a swirlwind. Investigating the murder of Stuart gave him a bone-chilling sensation. The images of the crime scene fresh in his mind. But a crime scene found in a zoo? He needed answers.\n\nEntering the coffee shop where Xanthe worked as a barista, Winston could see several customers waiting in line. Apparently, their coffee was popular in town. Xanthe could be seen behind the bar, engaging her clients, before she gracefully hurried over to the espresso machine. In that hurry, she accidentally drops a piece of paper. A customer quickly pointed it out, and Winston intervened to pick it up. \n\n\"That looks like a list of phone numbers,\" the customer said, peering over Winston's shoulder and noticing the peculiar numbers. \"Those aren't usual business or personal contacts. I work in telecommunications, I know.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Xanthe said, acknowledging the mishap, before busying herself again. \n\nWinston headed to the bar but opted not to order anything. Instead, he scanned the fallen paper. The now identified phone numbers seemed quite out of place.  \n\nThe Zoo's visitor logs showed that Stuart was a regular, showing up daily. He made a mental note of that. There was certainly a connection between Stuart and the coffee shop...with the baristas. Stuart was seen being quite friendly with the baristas, including the newcomer, Mary, whom he praised quite often. \n\n\"Was Stuart a regular here?\" Winston asked Xanthe.\n\n\"Yes,\" She responded warmly, \"he loved our coffee. Always praised Mary's hand.. She's pretty good, new or not. But you know, I was the one who used to make his coffee. Had his special recipe down, I did,\" She added, pointing towards a different espresso machine designated for complicated orders.\n\n\"Oh, that's interesting. You must have a busy schedule,\" Winston said offhandedly.\n\n\"Oh yeah, it includes working weekends too,\" Xanthe said, giving off a slight chuckle.\n\nAs Winston left the coffee shop, he recalled that Stuart's murder happened on a weekend. Winston knew this wasn't a coincidence, there was a complex web of intrigue developing here, leading him deeper into the mystery.\n\nWinston stared at the emails on Stuart's computer screen, reading about the deep financial holes Lowell had dug for his bank’s high profile clients. The source of these emails was unidentified, but they were enough to start a full-scale fraud investigation. It appeared that the businessman had been trading emails with Stuart not too long ago. It wasn't too hard to figure out why Stuart might've been targeted.\n\nHe looked over the police report, his cigar glowing in the dim room. It was late afternoon when the banking industry slows its hustle and bustle, that Stuart was found at the zoo.

Investigating the murder of Stuart gave him a bone-chilling sensation. The images of the crime scene fresh in his mind. But a crime scene found in a zoo? He needed answers.\\n\\nEntering the coffee shop where Xanthe worked as a barista, Winston could see several customers waiting in line. Apparently, their coffee was popular in town. Xanthe could be seen behind the bar, engaging her clients, before she gracefully hurried over to the espresso machine. In that hurry, she accidentally drops a piece of paper. A customer quickly pointed it out, and Winston intervened to pick it up. \\n\\n\\\"That looks like a list of phone numbers,\\\" the customer said, peering over Winston's shoulder and noticing the peculiar numbers. \\\"Those aren't usual business or personal contacts. I work in telecommunications, I know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thank you,\\\" Xanthe said, acknowledging the mishap, before busying herself again. \\n\\nWinston headed to the bar but opted not to order anything. Instead, he scanned the fallen paper. The now identified phone numbers seemed quite out of place.  \\n\\nThe Zoo's visitor logs showed that Stuart was a regular, showing up daily. He made a mental note of that. There was certainly a connection between Stuart and the coffee shop...with the baristas. Stuart was seen being quite friendly with the baristas, including the newcomer, Mary, whom he praised quite often. \\n\\n\\\"Was Stuart a regular here?\\\" Winston asked Xanthe.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" She responded warmly, \\\"he loved our coffee. Always praised Mary's hand.. She's pretty good, new or not. But you know, I was the one who used to make his coffee. Had his special recipe down, I did,\\\" She added, pointing towards a different espresso machine designated for complicated orders.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, that's interesting. You must have a busy schedule,\\\" Winston said offhandedly.\\n\\n\\\"Oh yeah, it includes working weekends too,\\\" Xanthe said, giving off a slight chuckle.\\n\\nAs Winston left the coffee shop, he recalled that Stuart's murder happened on a weekend. Winston knew this wasn't a coincidence, there was a complex web of intrigue developing here, leading him deeper into the mystery.\\n\\nWinston stared at the emails on Stuart's computer screen, reading about the deep financial holes Lowell had dug for his bank\\u2019s high profile clients. The source of these emails was unidentified, but they were enough to start a full-scale fraud investigation. It appeared that the businessman had been trading emails with Stuart not too long ago. It wasn't too hard to figure out why Stuart might've been targeted.\\n\\nHe looked over the police report, his cigar glowing in the dim room. It was late afternoon when the banking industry slows its hustle and bustle, that Stuart was found at the zoo. It was also the same time Lowell had a bank meeting at the branch near the zoo, according to the calendar reminder from Lowell's heavily incriminating laptop.\\n\\nAs Winston took a break from the case files, sipped coffee, and thought about his next move, he knew he needed to get over to the lumber yard.

Kaylee wrote, \"I must tell mom and dad about Penelope's past. They must know.\" Winston furrowed his brows, a nanny meeting her ward at such an odd place and knowing Kaylee, she wouldn't miss any other events or commitments. He had cross-checked Kaylee's schedule for that day, and there were no appointments or events that could contradict her plan to meet Penelope.\n\nThe diary held more surprises. Kaylee, innocent as she was, declared her intention of revealing Penelope's criminal past to her parents. No doubt Penelope knew. The thought of this exposure could overturn her life, costing her job and the respect she held in the community. A price too high to pay even for a remorseless criminal.\n\nHe glanced back at the diary. The meeting proved to be crucial. The factory was walking distance from Penelope's potter's bowled house, a home that served as the hub of the community's children. Additionally, Penelope was spotted leaving her house around the time of the meeting, walking with a sense of grim purpose. In her hand was an age-old pickaxe, which she wielded with an unsettling casualness.\n\nHis eyes flickered to the forensic report on his desk. The murder weapon was old and weathered, a mining pickaxe. The connection was too strong to dismiss- the same pickaxe Penelope was seen carrying before the murder, matched the brutal weapon used in the murder. \n\nWinston felt the sore pit of despair in his stomach. Penelope could suffer tremendous humiliation and the loss of everything dear to her if her past was revealed to Kaylee's parents. But the fact that she valued her job and social standing so severely made her the prime suspect. It was clear that she valued it more than anything, even more than upholding the law.\n\nStepping back from the pile of evidence, Winston inhaled a deep sigh. He wanted to make sense of this all, but it was not for him to corrupt the course of justice. He needed to let the facts speak for themselves, the same facts that were now undeniably pointing in one chilling direction.\n\nDetective Winston leaned back in his chair, sifting through the information before him. It was all a tangled mess--an ex-factory worker, Francis, whose wife had been found brutally murdered in the very factory he used to work at. \n         \nFrancis had occasionally talked about his days at the factory to his friends. Friends had mentioned about Francis reminiscing about his time at Old Mill factory. \"Francis, Bill, Daniel, Frank, Freddy...\" Winston muttered to himself, tracing the pattern with his finger.\n\nWinston spiraled in and out of the facts, unravelling the complexities layer by layer. The daughter. The hotel registries. The flipping between names. The Parent-Teacher meetings.\n\nDeciding to question Francis personally, Winston drove down to the local school where he found Francis engaged in a parent-teacher conference. Francis stood up on Winston's arrival, turned to the teacher next to him, Mary, and introduced himself as Freddy. He seemed genuinely ready to help in the investigation.\n           \nAt a local café, Jane walked up to Winston, recognizing him from the photo Francis had shown her. Francis had introduced himself to her as Frank. Jane was a recurring name in the twisting narrative of Francis.\n\nWinston briefed Francis about the facts surrounding Kaylee's murder while carefully watching his reactions. \"You used to work in the factory?\" he asked, already knowing the answer. \n\nFrancis nodded, \"Yes, worked there for years, before they shut it down.”\n\n\"And your daughter, she’s been seen with you frequently, stays with you during weekends?”\n\nFrancis shifted uncomfortably. \"Yes, that's...that's correct. She...well, she needs me.\"\n\nWinston remembered the therapist’s note about Francis's daughter attending regular therapy sessions. It was something to consider.\n\nThey moved to another question. \"Kaylee, was there an issue between your daughter and her?\"\n\nFrancis looked taken aback. \"What? No, not at all. They had... misunderstandings. Normal stuff.”\n\nWinston remembered a witness account of Kaylee yelling and acting aggressively towards the daughter. \"Are you often in town?\"\n\n\"Well, yes! I... yes, I mean... who isn't?”\n\nWinston decided not to light up the dichotomy of the hotel rooms and the different names. He wrapped up the meeting quietly.\n\nEarlier, as he had sifted through the hotel registries, Winston had found Francis's name on two dates. On August 5th, Francis had signed as \"Bill Norman\". A week later, on August 12th, a \"Daniel Smith\" had checked in. Both operational names of Francis. \n\nDuring his drive back to the station on the afternoon of August 12, the same unfortunate day Hampton found Kaylee's body in the factory, Winston replayed the meeting in his mind. The complexity of the situation was mind-boggling – a murder tied to an abandoned factory, a man with many names, a daughter in therapy, the translucent shield of parent-teacher involvement, and the ghost of past echoes in the disused factory.\n\nWinston parked his car and quietly noted down the date, the same one as the second hotel registry listing Francis - as Daniel Smith - and realized he was seen in town that very day.\n\nThe mystery deepened, and the facts were only getting murkier.", "question": "Who is the most likely murderer?", "choices": "['Penelope', 'Francis']", "answer_index": 0, "answer_choice": "Penelope"}, "target": "(`)", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": ["[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please answer the following question with (a), (b), (c), (d) \\n\\nIn the dim light of an abandoned factory, Kaylee's lifeless body lay with the cold steel of a pickaxe lodged within, thrusting Detective Winston into a dark game of deception with suspects Penelope and Francis.\\n\\nAs Winston shuffled the documents strewn across his desk, one caught his eye: a diary entry.

How are you tonight?\" Winston greeted, removing his hat as he gently knocked on the front door.\n\n\"Doing well, Detective. Or at least as well as could be hoped for, considering the troubling news,\" she replied, her worry lines dominating her once youthful face. \n\nPushing through the clutter of children's toys, books, and pictures that decorated her home, Winston made a note of the degree in childcare on her mantel. He knew Penelope had dedicated the last decade of her life to working with children, a job she loved, but one that would undoubtedly be threatened if her past felonies were exposed. Kaylee, the young girl whose diary lay open on Winston's desk, had found out about Penelope's criminal past and had penned an entry declaring a plan to tell her parents.\n\nWinston glanced at his notepad, the flowery script of Kaylee's last diary entry etched in his mind - a firm promise to meet Penelope, distinctly noting the abandoned factory as their rendezvous point.\n\nPenelope paced around the room, her eyes darting every so often to the letter box then nervously to the quiet street.

This peculiar deviation from her childcare routine was more disconcerting considering Penelope had no formal training in mortuary science.\n\nAs he left, Winston cast one final glance at the pickaxe, a haunting replica of the murder weapon according to his sources.

The crime scene was an eerie desolate factory where Francis used to work. A connection that seemed too coincidental to disregard.

He'd also seen Francis buying a pickaxe in a supplies shop, a memory strikingly pungent with the horror of the murder tied with the same tool. He had also witnessed Francis fervently striking up conversation about his time spent mining, casually showcasing his familiarity with pickaxes as he described his former job.

They depicted the daily life of a woman maintaining an intense physical regimen. She was fit, she was disciplined. A disciplined, successful wrestler.\n\nThe sun faded into the horizon as he stared at the record of the wrestling event Octavia had been part of and for which she had been granted a day-release pass. The sign-off from the warden stood out even in the dimming twilight. In Winston's years of experience, it was a rare thing for a prisoner to be given such a privilege, but to wrestle? That was unheard of.\n\nOctavia, however, was an exception. She reportedly kept up her wrestling training in prison, rigorously keeping in shape. This explained her winning streak in the prison's wrestling records. But it didn't explain everything.\n\nA chill wind swept through the yard and Winston flipped a page, his eyes catching on a note about Octavia's disciplinary actions. Several infractions, including her use of illegal foreign objects in wrestling matches, her attacks on other inmates – even using a tray as a weapon once – were duly noted.\n\nIt was the mention of her being caught as she attempted to steal from the prison’s medical ward though, that drew Winston's attention back. This was a woman fighting, desperate even, against the grips of drug addiction. Withdrawal symptoms were known to be brutal, but rarely did prisoners resort to such extreme measures.\n\nMoving next to Stuart's file, it was clear his troubles began long before his death. Notorious from his time smuggling drugs, he later succumbed to the law's pressure and put a stop to his operations. It was a known fact he later became a regular at wrestling events, noticing Octavia there more than once. A rehabilitation, or an escape, who could tell?\n\nWhether his love for wrestling drew him into proximity with Octavia, or his previous life of drug-running played a part, was unclear. But while drug addiction had inflamed Octavia’s desire for the substances Stuart had dealt in his past, she too shared a passion for the wrestling spectacles for which he was known. Their paths certainly crossed more than once on wrestling's squared circle.\n\nAs Winston compiled his notes, having immersed himself in the life histories of both Stuart and Octavia, he felt a strange connection between them.

He absently flipped through the case file of Uma, somehow the atmosphere matching the mournful story he was reading.\n\nAccording to the notes, Uma was a trainer and part-time script consultant at the same fitness center where Irving, the suspect, also trained. Both typically scheduled their workouts late in the evening, customarily ending when the gym was mostly vacant. The evening Uma met her untimely demise, irrefutable evidence shows Irving stayed later than she did, apparently relishing the solitude. The stark lighting of the closed gym only added to the chilly atmosphere.\n\nWinston carefully sipped his coffee, the bitter taste pulling him from his reverie. Grabbing his notepad, he jotted down a few points to discuss with Irving. Apart from his regular gym routine, various aspects of his writing career were catching Winston's eye.\n\nIrving was known for his precise work on scripts, specifically for his detailed research into harmful substances, even down to their handling and utilization. His alarmingly realistic work had earned him a strange kind of reputation, though no one could deny it fascinated viewers.\n\nGiven this, Uma’s claim that Irving stole her work didn’t seem so far off. Looking closely at her file again, Winston found a direct threat from Uma stating she would expose Irving's deception to the public. It seemed like this plagiarism accusation had Irving on edge, a tension that seemed to whisper of something dangerous. \n\nHeading out of the diner, Winston decided to head over to Irving’s apartment. It was a short drive, the buildings looming against the gloomy sky forebodingly, each window alight as though the eyes of some unseen spectators.\n\nAs he approached the building, he recalled a report of Irving carrying a vial from his car to his apartment. The vial itself seemed ordinary but combined with his previous online purchases of corrosive substances from a store, it painted a grim picture.\n\nUpon reaching the apartment, his observational skills kicked in, the detective noting the absence of lights; Irving had not yet returned home. His mind wandered back to the fitness center, and the reports claiming that Irving usually stayed late rang even truer considering the current time.\n\n\"Hey, Winston,\" barked a voice over the phone, pulling him back to reality. \n\n\"Irving went home, got caught in the morning traffic. You guess what he drove?\"\n\nWinston sighed, the picture painfully clear. \"I'm guessing it was a car.\"\n\n\"Well, today's just full of surprises for you, innit? Yeah, it was the car,\" the officer on the other line chuckled before he hung up.\n\nWinston leaned against the chilling wall, thoughts whirling around in his mind, the proverbially web becoming denser with each passing moment. Irving had a lot to answer for, and that included what happened the tragic night Uma was murdered.\n\nWinston squinted at the digital clock on his car's dashboard; it was 7 p.m., Uma's workout time, the hour at which the tragedy had unfolded. Winston seemed to have developed a knack for piecing together the minutiae of his victim's lives, to the point he often found himself involved in their routines. Not too far from Uma's favourite treadmills, he could see Addison, Uma's personal trainer, putting another client through his paces. \n\n\"I heard about Uma.\" The trace of guilt was ever so subtle in Addison's voice. \n\n\"I suppose you were her trainer?\" Winston asked, casually observing the gym. \n\n\"Yes, Uma had a steady workout routine.

He couldn’t help but feel the increasing pressure of the time crunch.\n\nIrving was not an ordinary man. Winston had discovered from the interviews and police records that the guy particularly had some weird habits. Irving, it seemed, was battling insomnia and was unable to sleep in his own home at night. During these restless nights, he would busy himself with his notebooks. Often, he was seen at the fitness center, sketching intriguing symbols into his notebook, which he always carried along with his pencil. He would leave home with these immediately after sunset.\n\nOne specific detail that struck the detective was Irving's fascination with themes and symbols of the past, particularly those formed by ancient gravestones.

Like the deceased Uma, he seemed to utilized the solitude that the near-empty gym provided, allowing him ample time alone.\n\nThe lines on Winston's forehead became more pronounced as he read on. He found a strange connection between both Uma's and Irving's lives. Not only did they work out at the same gym, but they also shared a professional conflict. Reports indicated that Uma had discovered Irving's success was largely built on her own work which he'd plagiarized.

So, he decided to continue with the investigation, waiting for the breakthrough that would add some clarity to the clouded picture. He had a late-night meeting with the prime suspect, Irving, in the pipeline. It was indeed time to probe further and extract some answers from the silence of the night.\n\nIn the busy forensics lab, Winston was studying the crime scene photos in silence. A woman named Uma, well known for her steadfast commitment to a fitness regimen, was the unfortunate victim. She was murdered during her normal workout hours.\n\nThe cops had discovered her body at the local fitness center, unease casting dark shadows over the typically vibrant atmosphere. Addison, a dual-timer as a gym trainer and a science teacher, was the main person of interest in the case.\n\nA patrol had brought in Addison's home chemistry set for further forensic analysis. An array of flasks, test tubes and a considerable stash of acid were lying on the evidence table, leading Winston to deduce that Addison frequently stored acid at home. \n\nWinston picked up his coat and made his way to the fitness center to meet with Addison.

The discrepancies had coincided with Addison's tenure at the gym. It was also not lost on Winston that coincidentally Uma had discovered Addison's theft only days before her murder. This fact added a new depth of motive to his crime profile.\n\nWith his thanks, Winston left Addison in deafening silence, leaving him to mull over the implications.

When questioned about Uma, his personal training client, Addison turned a shade paler. He was present during her murder.\\n\\nHe brought up the gym safe next: \\\"You've been seen accessing it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yeah, I... um, take cash out for gym expenses,\\\" Addison stammered, betraying some nervousness.\\n\\nWinston knew that the gym had recently faced some financial discrepancies. The discrepancies had coincided with Addison's tenure at the gym. It was also not lost on Winston that coincidentally Uma had discovered Addison's theft only days before her murder. This fact added a new depth of motive to his crime profile.\\n\\nWith his thanks, Winston left Addison in deafening silence, leaving him to mull over the implications. Each fact snugly fit into the puzzle he was solving, but the sheer absurdity of the circumstances was distressing.

A grim thought etched itself into his mind as he thought about the unlocked front door, later found locked from the outside, and the lifeless body of Charlotte inside.\n\nWinston stepped out of the vehicle, reviewing the case notes. He needed to talk to the last person to see Charlotte alive - Deborah, the driver that Charlotte had recently hired and brought over explicitly for a job discussion.\n\nThrough office gossip, Winston had heard about Charlotte’s demeaning behavior.

{"doc_id": 244, "doc": {"narrative": "In a chilling turn of events, Rose is found lifeless in a car, killed by a vial of acid, leading Detective Winston to the affluent suspects, Daisy and Dexter.\n\nWinston was going over the facts of the case when he decided to visit the suspect, Daisy. Daisy wasn't your typical suspect - she was a singer who always had a passion for her art form, a passion that stood in sharp contrast with her family's dismissive attitude.\n\n“I'm just trying to get ahead in life, you know?\" she told Winston as they sat in a small cafe near one of her repeat performance venues - an old building that was frequently harshly criticised for its lack of cleanliness. \"They never cared about my music… always thought it was just a phase. I couldn't stand their lack of support.”\n\nGetting rid of her family members from her contacts was, as she put it, a \"cleansing experience\". It was all very telling of Daisy's meticulous nature - she extended the same cleanliness philosophy to everything in her personal life, hygiene being her top priority; it gave a stark contrast to the venues in which she performed.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, she casually added, \"Sometimes my sarcasm gets the best of me. I can't tell you how many family dinners I've ruined with it. My sarcasm stings so hard, it often leaves them in tears.\"\n\nWinston thought about Rose, who often parked her car in the same vicinity. \"You were scheduled to perform at a place near that parking lot that day… right?\" he asked. Daisy affirmed the fact and mentioned having seen Rose's car, acknowledging that she and Rose were the last two people in the vehicle after her show that night.\n\nAs part of her performances, Daisy often integrated different kinds of acid into her routines - the same kind, as it turned out, that had been used to murder Rose. A cold chill ran down Winston’s spine as he mentally cross-checked the evidence list.\n\n“Acid isn’t a typical instrument for a singer, Daisy...\" Winston quizzed, trying to keep the conversation casual. Daisy just shrugged, \"Got to create a spectacle, right? Attract an audience?”\n\nDaisy had always been adamant about not attending any family gatherings - a fact that did not change even after Rose’s death. But she claimed to hold no ill-will towards Rose. As Winston got up from the table to leave, he turned one final time to look at Daisy who was now alone and engrossed in her phone. A suspect or not, one thing was certain, the story was far from over.\n\nWinston reeked of grease and sweat as he strolled into the electronics store, blinking against the twisted glare of neon and the sharp gleam of fluorescent lights. Dexter, a wiry man in neatly pressed slacks and a polo, paused in checking and restocking the freshly stocked batteries to greet him.\n\n\"You look lost, sir,\" he called, a spark in his eyes belying the monotony in his voice.\n\n\"Actually, I have a few questions for you, if that's not too much trouble,\" Winston started, flipping open his notepad to gather his thoughts.\n\nA flicker of unease crossed Dexter’s face, but he masked it quickly, \"Sure, always happy to help.\"\n\nWinston dove straight in, \"Know a woman by the name of Rose?\"\n\nDexter's face tightened imperceptibly. \"Rose, yeah. I know of her. She left her car here to get cleaned the other day. She told me that she had found an embarrassing picture of me somewhere.\"\n\n\"So, you work on cars too?\"\n\n\"I... not exactly. I was on duty when she came by.

Daisy wasn't your typical suspect - she was a singer who always had a passion for her art form, a passion that stood in sharp contrast with her family's dismissive attitude.\\n\\n\\u201cI'm just trying to get ahead in life, you know?\\\" she told Winston as they sat in a small cafe near one of her repeat performance venues - an old building that was frequently harshly criticised for its lack of cleanliness. \\\"They never cared about my music\\u2026 always thought it was just a phase. I couldn't stand their lack of support.\\u201d\\n\\nGetting rid of her family members from her contacts was, as she put it, a \\\"cleansing experience\\\". It was all very telling of Daisy's meticulous nature - she extended the same cleanliness philosophy to everything in her personal life, hygiene being her top priority; it gave a stark contrast to the venues in which she performed.\\n\\nAfter a moment of silence, she casually added, \\\"Sometimes my sarcasm gets the best of me. I can't tell you how many family dinners I've ruined with it. My sarcasm stings so hard, it often leaves them in tears.\\\"\\n\\nWinston thought about Rose, who often parked her car in the same vicinity. \\\"You were scheduled to perform at a place near that parking lot that day\\u2026 right?\\\" he asked. Daisy affirmed the fact and mentioned having seen Rose's car, acknowledging that she and Rose were the last two people in the vehicle after her show that night.\\n\\nAs part of her performances, Daisy often integrated different kinds of acid into her routines - the same kind, as it turned out, that had been used to murder Rose. A cold chill ran down Winston\\u2019s spine as he mentally cross-checked the evidence list.\\n\\n\\u201cAcid isn\\u2019t a typical instrument for a singer, Daisy...\\\" Winston quizzed, trying to keep the conversation casual. Daisy just shrugged, \\\"Got to create a spectacle, right? Attract an audience?\\u201d\\n\\nDaisy had always been adamant about not attending any family gatherings - a fact that did not change even after Rose\\u2019s death. But she claimed to hold no ill-will towards Rose. As Winston got up from the table to leave, he turned one final time to look at Daisy who was now alone and engrossed in her phone. A suspect or not, one thing was certain, the story was far from over.\\n\\nWinston reeked of grease and sweat as he strolled into the electronics store, blinking against the twisted glare of neon and the sharp gleam of fluorescent lights. Dexter, a wiry man in neatly pressed slacks and a polo, paused in checking and restocking the freshly stocked batteries to greet him.\\n\\n\\\"You look lost, sir,\\\" he called, a spark in his eyes belying the monotony in his voice.\\n\\n\\\"Actually, I have a few questions for you, if that's not too much trouble,\\\" Winston started, flipping open his notepad to gather his thoughts.\\n\\nA flicker of unease crossed Dexter\\u2019s face, but he masked it quickly, \\\"Sure, always happy to help.\\\"\\n\\nWinston dove straight in, \\\"Know a woman by the name of Rose?\\\"\\n\\nDexter's face tightened imperceptibly. \\\"Rose, yeah. I know of her. She left her car here to get cleaned the other day.

The man had a certain peculiar charm; he seemed more like an impish professor than a sales associate at an electronics store. Following the conversation, Winston found his gaze drawn to a large cardboard box residing in one corner of the store.

The picture was now a town legend, circulating far and wide.\n\nAs he put the album down, Winston glanced towards the wall clock. The late afternoon sun was shifting into evening.

Winston thanked him politely and went on his way.\n\nThe detective, Winston, had strong coffee in his hand as he reviewed the case files laid out in front of him.

Staying in shape was crucial for catching suspects on foot. But even he was taken aback by the sheer enormity of Van, the local bodybuilder. The rumor in town was that Van had been recently struggling with large debts. The man stood near six and a half feet tall, his enormous physique a testament to the countless hours he obviously spent in the gym, instead of accepting invitations to the various social events.\n\nWinston felt like David meeting Goliath as he marched towards the muscular man. \"Hey, Van?\" He called out, to which the man gave a mere grunt in response. Several people in the gym watched as the scene unfolded; in this place, Van was a sort of brawny legend who preferred the solitude of his weights over any socializing. Just the other day, a friend had asked him about his dating life with Xenia, but he brushed it aside.\n\n\"Detective Winston. I'd like to ask you a few questions,\" Winston showed his badge. \"About Xenia.\"\n\nVan was taken-aback by the upfrontness of the question. He grunted again, this time out of exasperation. \n\n\"Detective, didn't expect that one coming,\" he said finally lifting his head to acknowledge the detective. \"Alright, shoot.\"\n\nWinston pulled out his notebook and an envelope from the local hardware store, \"Did you take a construction safety course recently?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I used to build furniture for fun,\" Van answered in between grunts, continuing his reps, \"Safety first and all that.\"\n\n\"And did this fascination with construction lead you to buying a nail gun?\" Winston asked, pulling a purchase receipt out of the envelope. \"The receipt I found in your wallet indicates you bought the same model used for Xenia's murder.\"\n\nVan's expression changed for the first time, a small frown appeared on his face. \"Yeah, why?\"\n\n\"There's no easy way to say this...\" Winston gathered his words, \"but Xenia, she's been killed. She was shot with a nail gun. The same type that you recently bought.\"\n\nVan's barbell dropped onto the floor with a loud crash. \"Xenia is dead?\" he asked in disbelief. \n\nWinston confirmed with a solemn nod. \"She recently updated her life insurance policy, which you had changed to make you the sole beneficiary.\" He added, \"The payout would be considerable, enough to solve your debt troubles.\"\n\nDisbelief crossed Van's face. He ruffled his hair nervously before swiftly changing the topic, \"I hit a new record today. 350 pounds.\"\n\nA change in topic wasn't unusual when dealing with shock, to Winston's experience. He however, decided to dive ahead, \"Xenia's will and her life insurance policy, which amounts to a hefty sum of $1.2 million, put a lot of money in your name, Van.\"\n\nVan swiftly stood from his weight bench, a scowl deepening on his face. \"Are you implying I killed her for her money?\"\n\n\"Just figuring out what happened,\" Winston calmly replied.\n\n\"Well, if that's all detective, you'll have to excuse me. I've got to... digest this information,\" Van said, storming out of the gym.\n\nWinston watched him leave, noting that for someone who'd just lost someone close, Van seemed to recover pretty fast. He jotted down a final note: 'Van wasn't much for social events, but he certainly had his priorities set on the gym.' With a sigh, he reached for his phone... There was more investigation to be done.\n\nWinston pulled into his usual parking spot at the bustling shopping mall, where Xenia had been found dead. Taking a moment, he observed the familiar sight of storied storefronts and the commotion of shoppers going about their business – everything seemed normal, but its surface was marred by the undercurrent of a sinister act.\n\nStepping out, Winston headed towards the scene of the crime, where Xenia's body was discovered amongst the kaleidoscope of mall storefronts.\n\nSuddenly, his phone rang. Winston answered it briskly, \"This is Winston.\"\n\n\"This is Janet from Dispatch. Got a preliminary report back. The murder weapon was a nail gun... reportedly missing from a nearby construction site.\" Janet informed him.\n\n\"Interesting... thanks, Janet.\" Winston said before hanging up.\n\nOne person in mind, Winston mused, Wilfred, a city lawyer handling the lawsuit against the mall’s recent haphazardly built expansion – he was known to have some construction experience with a reported affinity for nail guns. Funny little detail that used to be an innocence quirk of Wilfred’s. After all, the nail gun was reported missing from Wilfred’s construction project.\n\nWinston walked into the site of construction, observing the works and chaos of a massive project, evidence of Wilfred’s connection with the site.\n\nLater, Winston decided to pay Wilfred a visit. Finding him in his office, Winston pulled out a photo from his coat pocket and tossed it on Wilfred's desk – a grainy shot from a CCTV footage showing Wilfred in the mall at the time of Xenia’s death.\n\nWilfred squinted at the image, evidently uncomfortable. With his back turned to Winston, working late at his desk, he seemed just as any other lawyer.\n\n\"Wilfred, doing some moonlighting at the mall, were you?\" Winston asked, his tone casual yet probing.\n\n\"I... I do my evening walks there sometimes,\" Wilfred replied.\n\nWinston pulled out another document from his coat pocket, \"You may want to come down to the station, Wilfred.

As allegations of political scandal were beginning to surround Wilfred, Xenia had somehow been caught in the crossfire. She paid a high price, killed during a time when Wilfred had no alibi, when his whereabouts were unknown to all.\n\nThe lawyer’s life slowly gave away a shade that Winston hadn't exactly expected.

{"doc_id": 249, "doc": {"narrative": "In the glimmering lights and pulsating bass of the local roller rink, Wendy met her brutal end with a pickaxe, leaving Detective Winston the unenviable task of untangling suspect stories from Marianne and Sidney.\n\nWinston ran his fingers through his tangled hair as he fixated on the aged screen of the department’s underfunded monitor. It projected grainy CCTV footage of his suspect - Marianne. She was there at the roller rink, on the night poor Wendy met her end. Not only was Marianne there - she was seen shouting at Wendy, their voices escalating until they pierced the rhythmic hum of the skating wheels. The timestamp of the argument, and subsequent footage of Marianne lingering, suggested she was there for quite some time after her dispute with Wendy.\n\nHe thumbed through a thin folder tucked beneath a closing pizza box resting on his cluttered desk. Marianne had a criminal record, it revealed a past fraught with moments of explosion, of violence - including an assault arrest five years prior. The Marianne on the screen, the Marianne in these documents had been caught in the wrong before. Winston began to feel a creeping uneasiness as he parsed this correlation. \n\nSeveral pictures tumbled from the folder as Winston shuffled its contents. The pictures were snapshots of Marianne: caught in the midst of her day-to-day, widely recognized by the community - not just for her nature but for her frequent use of an old pickaxe. It came as no surprise since she had spent several years working in the mines before her marriage. She was seen using her pickaxe for numerous tasks such as chopping firewood or loosening soil in her garden. \n\n\"Did you see what she was doing last week?\" a seasoned woman down the road had mentioned as she was reversing her car out of the driveway. Marianne was seen cleaning her well-worn mining equipment that she'd kept stored in an easily accessible tool-shed next to her house in clear sight. It seemed she wasn't shy about flaunting her past or the tools she used while in the mines.\n\nCommotion at the precinct broke Winston from his thoughts. The crime-scene analyst reported the murder took place in some remote corner of the roller rink. Despite the public dispute that took place earlier between Wendy and Marianne, this location seemed isolated, uncanny for such a busy locale.\n\nThe analyst's words seemed to chisel further into Winston's thoughts as he returned to the grainy images. Her mining equipment was never far from reach, and Marian's cacophony on the night of Wendy's murder was caught on tape. \n\nPieces started falling into place; too many strings tethered Marianne to the night Wendy was murdered. With a sigh, Winston allowed himself a quiet moment. Then, taking a deep breath, he began his descent into the intricacies of the case before him.\n\nWinston stood at the entrance of the roller rink, eyes scanning the room. The images from the forensics timeline replayed in his memory. Poor Wendy was murdered between 7 to 9 pm, coinciding perfectly with the time Sidney usually spent at the rink. The roller rink, a place that normally buzzed with the rejuvenating sounds of retro music and flashing lights, had become her death place.\n\nSidney, who was a geologist, had been seen with Wendy at the roller rink multiple times. According to the staff, Sidney was even a regular here. It was a curious detail but not unusual, people had hobbies apart from their professions.\n\nChecking his notes from the previous conversation with Sidney, his eyebrows knitted slightly at the desperation he had sensed from Sidney. It revolved around Wendy, who apparently knew something he coveted as a secret. She apparently had been sharing this secret with her friends, and it seemed it held the power to publicly humiliate Sidney if it ever came to light. Sidney, for his part, vehemently denied any secret of such scale.\n\nWinston gestured for the barista to come over. The young man with a skater haircut glanced at Winston's badge before he ordered a black coffee with no sugar. While waiting for his order, he asked, “Did you notice Sidney here during the time of the incident?”\n\nThe barista nodded, nervously biting his lower lip. \"Yes, Detective. Sidney was here. I remember seeing him from 7 to 9 pm, during the time that Wendy was murdered.\"\n\nWinston nodded as he continued his observations. His gaze lingered over Sidney's station where he parked his geologist equipment when he visited. He noticed the stains of regular wear and tear and a freshly cleaned pickaxe leaning against the wall. Nothing unusual for a geologist. Taking down notes, Winston silently queued the information; that very pickaxe might have been used for the murder.\n\nHis phone buzzed breaking his trail of thoughts, He took the informer's call. He glanced at his watch, noting down the time of the conversation before disconnecting the call. He finished his coffee and left the roller rink. He had to confirm if Wendy was indeed telling the truth about that secret or Sidney was just an innocent geologist who loved rollerblading and hated gossip.", "question": "Who is the most likely murderer?", "choices": "['Marianne', 'Sidney']", "answer_index": 1, "answer_choice": "Sidney"}, "target": "(a)", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": ["[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please answer the following question with (a), (b), (c), (d) \\n\\nIn the glimmering lights and pulsating bass of the local roller rink, Wendy met her brutal end with a pickaxe, leaving Detective Winston the unenviable task of untangling suspect stories from Marianne and Sidney.\\n\\nWinston ran his fingers through his tangled hair as he fixated on the aged screen of the department\\u2019s underfunded monitor. It projected grainy CCTV footage of his suspect - Marianne. She was there at the roller rink, on the night poor Wendy met her end. Not only was Marianne there - she was seen shouting at Wendy, their voices escalating until they pierced the rhythmic hum of the skating wheels. The timestamp of the argument, and subsequent footage of Marianne lingering, suggested she was there for quite some time after her dispute with Wendy.\\n\\nHe thumbed through a thin folder tucked beneath a closing pizza box resting on his cluttered desk. Marianne had a criminal record, it revealed a past fraught with moments of explosion, of violence - including an assault arrest five years prior. The Marianne on the screen, the Marianne in these documents had been caught in the wrong before. Winston began to feel a creeping uneasiness as he parsed this correlation. \\n\\nSeveral pictures tumbled from the folder as Winston shuffled its contents. The pictures were snapshots of Marianne: caught in the midst of her day-to-day, widely recognized by the community - not just for her nature but for her frequent use of an old pickaxe. It came as no surprise since she had spent several years working in the mines before her marriage. She was seen using her pickaxe for numerous tasks such as chopping firewood or loosening soil in her garden. \\n\\n\\\"Did you see what she was doing last week?\\\" a seasoned woman down the road had mentioned as she was reversing her car out of the driveway. Marianne was seen cleaning her well-worn mining equipment that she'd kept stored in an easily accessible tool-shed next to her house in clear sight. It seemed she wasn't shy about flaunting her past or the tools she used while in the mines.\\n\\nCommotion at the precinct broke Winston from his thoughts. The crime-scene analyst reported the murder took place in some remote corner of the roller rink. Despite the public dispute that took place earlier between Wendy and Marianne, this location seemed isolated, uncanny for such a busy locale.\\n\\nThe analyst's words seemed to chisel further into Winston's thoughts as he returned to the grainy images. Her mining equipment was never far from reach, and Marian's cacophony on the night of Wendy's murder was caught on tape. \\n\\nPieces started falling into place; too many strings tethered Marianne to the night Wendy was murdered.
