A murder case at a bungee jumping site was definitely out of the ordinary. Today's victim was a young man named Mack, loud mouthed and cocky by all accounts. \n\nMack was bungee jumping the day he was killed. Oddly enough, according to the records, no one else was documented at the bungee jumping site that day, making this case even more peculiar. The first stop for the day was to visit one of Mack's housemates, a woman named Ana. They were seen leaving in the same vehicle from their shared housing complex the morning of the murder, and it was time for Winston to dig deeper. \n\nAs he pulled into the shared housing driveway, a nondescript car came into sight. He learned from neighbours that it was frequently used by multiple residents, but Ana had a peculiar interest in it. She would insist on driving whenever with a group of friends, later meticulously cleaning the car after each use. An idiosyncrasy of hers maybe, but a part of the puzzle nonetheless.\n\nWinston knocked on the door, Ana opened it warily, twiddling a cleaning cloth and spray in her hands and greeted him with a nervous nod. Ana gets nervous and fidgets with the cleaner and cloth when questioned. Winston could sense palpable unease as he started asking her questions.\n\n\"Ana, did you not join Mack and the others for bungee jumping today?\" Winston questioned, to which she responded, \"I signed up to jump. But I didn't end up going through with it.\"\n\n\"Any particular reason you didn't join the others, Ana?\" Winston proceeded. \n\nAna took a deep breath, \"Well sir, my faith doesn't really permit bungee jumping. Truth be told, I was persuaded strongly by Mack. I had even signed up out of peer pressure but couldn't push myself.\"\n\nIt was true – Mack was insisting that everyone in the group should bungee jump. Mack had reportedly also been vocal about ridiculing Ana’s faith, even encouraging others to join him in doing so. It was a significant factor in their relationship.\n\n\"Ana, did you and Mack leave in the same car for the bungee jumping event this morning?\" Winston gently pushed further.\n\n\"Yes. Yes, we did. We always carpool.\" She responded while anxiously using the cleaner and cloth on her car’s dashboard. Her eyes flickered nervously back to Winston, expecting the next question.\n\nWinston took a deep breath, standing up to leave, \"Alright Ana, that should cover everything for now. We'll be in touch.\"\n\nAna nervously nodded without looking up from her cleaning, wringing the cloth repeatedly as Winston walked away, left again with another piece to the enigmatic puzzle of Mack's murder.\n\nThe day was getting older and Winston was getting more tired, but the case was fresh, and he wasn't one to back down. He tugged on his coat as he approached the bashful teen waiting for him by the police station.\n\n\"Mackenzie, it is?\" he asked, extending his hand.\n\n\"Yeah, that's right.\" The slight lisp, overlaid with blanket anxiety, confirmed what the school reports suggested.\n\n\"You were at the site when Mack... erm... you know,\" Winston's voice was methodical, calm -- almost robotic. The suspicion on Mackenzie was not unfounded - the security cameras showed him buying nunchaku a week before. \n\nMackenzie shifted on his feet, looking away before answering, \"Yeah, I was there.\"\n\nWinston pulled out a small notebook, \"What were you doing there, Mackenzie?”\n\n“Bungee jumping, like Mack… Then I left. I didn't... I didn't do anything…” Mackenzie replied.\n\nInternally, Winston sighed at the never-ending waterfall of teenage angst this case was turning into. \n\n“Martial arts, huh?” Winston segued, gesturing to a bruise on Mackenzie’s knuckles. “Nunchaku particularly, I see? Training does include the use of those, correct?” \n\nThe change in Mackenzie’s demeanor mirrored the bitterness in the last month’s weather – dark eyes replaced with ice-cold ones. “Yeah,” he admitted, shrinking slightly.\n\nMackenzie always took pride in being the best at everything. So when Mack got everything he wanted - the promotion to team captain, the respect, the attention - it was a hard pill for Mackenzie to swallow. Winston remembered the team talk, Mackenzie was indeed the top candidate but it had gone to Mack instead. \n\nWhat clinched it was Mackenzie’s remarks about Mack, echoing whispers of dispute and bickering, lost in the crowded lunchroom. There were also multiple witness reports of the two seen arguing at the bungee jumping site previously. Mackenzie had indeed said disparaging, almost emotional things about Mack – all stemming from a potent brew of jealousy, Winston inferred.\n\nShifting later through the detritus of Mackenzie's life, Winston discovered the nunchaku that matched the forensics report.

He observed Mackenzie through his binoculars, watching closely as they hastily unlocked their front door. It had been a long day at the office for Mackenzie and, like clockwork, they were seen taking their customary break on a public bench, working on their laptop.\n\nBefore long, Mackenzie was seen through the partially closed blinds of their apartment, sitting at their desk with their laptop open. They had just returned from a local cyber security meetup, a reality Winston discovered after following Mackenzie to the event later that evening. As Winston watched, they shifted their body and their eyes darted around, Winston duly noted on Mackenzie's apparent concern for online privacy.\n\n\"Interesting,\" Winston thought, while making a mental note to do some research on further cyber security meetups occurring in the vicinity.\n\nThe next morning, Winston watched Mackenzie walk out of a martial arts training center. As Mackenzie stopped to say goodbye to their instructor, Winston quickly snapped a photo on his phone. In the picture, Winston could clearly see Mackenzie practicing techniques with the unmistakable form of Mackenzie's sturdy nunchaku resting in the backdrop. This gave Winston a clue that his martial arts training includes nunchaku techniques.\n\nWinston's interest peaked further when he followed Mackenzie to a local shop where they were seen purchasing a new set of nunchaku. Even more intriguing was when they examined a pair of cufflinks on display with a yearning look, cufflinks Winston knew were identical to a pair Mack frequently flaunted around. It appeared Mack had things that Mackenzie also desired.\n\nThe investigator decided it was time to pay Mackenzie a visit. He knocked on the apartment door and Mackenzie cautiously invited him in.\n\nPleasantries were briefly exchanged before Winston's gaze quickly fell on the laptop that was resting by some papers next to an open window.\n\n\"You always take this with you to work?\" Winston inquired, pointing at the laptop.\n\n\"Every day,\" Mackenzie replied, \"I can't leave my work at the office.\"\n\n\"Work goes that well, huh?\" Winston probed further. \"I hear you were recently ... overlooked for a promotion.\"\n\nAt these words, Mackenzie's expression darkened. \"I was the top candidate, you know. It should've been mine. Mack, the new guy, he is nothing compared to me, but he takes it. That promotion, the respect I had. Even those cufflinks I have always wanted, somehow Mack always gets to have them.\"\n\nWinston nodded, making a mental note of Mackenzie's reaction. They turned the conversation to martial arts and during the chat, Mackenzie unintentionally revealed their prowess with nunchaku.\n\nIn a small, hidden compartment in Mackenzie's wardrobe, Winston found the pair of nunchaku that Mackenzie had recently purchased. He swiftly snapped a picture of this evidence before closing the wardrobe.\n\nAs the day grew late, Winston thanked Mackenzie for their time and headed out, feeling more certain than ever about the path his investigation was following.\n\nWinston sat in his office, photos of Mack --the bungee jumper found dead-- scattered heartbreakingly across his desk. The lack of clues at the murder site puzzled him, nothing seemed out of place. All he had was an unusual weapon, the nunchaku, not something he’d found at too many crime scenes.\n\nStanding up, he straightened his tie and headed to the shared housing complex of the victim and suspect. Ana Diaz lived here, along with Mack. Ground rules for questioning the suspect were laid out in his mind.\n\nAna received him with a stoic expression and invited him inside. Her suitcase was unpacked, strewn helter-skelter around the room. She explained she had come back from the bungee jumping site late last night, still in shock about Mack’s murder.\n\nNunchaku lay on the table.

{"doc_id": 2, "doc": {"narrative": "In the haze of neon lights and the serving of a silent hand of fate, Timothy lies dead in a casino, a sai his cruel end, leaving the unruffled Detective Winston to interrogate suspects, Harry and Rosemary.\n\nIt had been a long day for Winston. The air was heavy with the scent of fresh coffee and the clamour of a bustling restaurant kitchen. His eyes fell on a seasoned chef, Rosemary, as she deftly wielded her bladed tools — knives, cleavers, graters — with calm precision. Watching her, it came as no surprise that Rosemary had clocked several years in this industry.\n\nSomething in the room changed. Shouting ensued, then a loud crash that rang out above the normal kitchen discord. Rosemary had hurled a metal pot across the room. The assistant, who stood close by, looked shocked but unharmed. Winston decided it was his cue to intervene.\n\n\"Rosemary, care to explain what just happened?\" Winston asked, stepping closer to the irate chef.\n\nShe gave him a guarded look before deliberately changing the subject, \"Did you know Timothy was a fan of my stir fry? Ironic, isn't it?\"\n\nWinston frowned slightly at the statement but decided to push forward. He knew how to dance around subjects, but Rosemary seemed skilled at the bucolic ballet of the restaurant business.\n\n\"I've heard some disturbing claims, Rosemary,\" Winston brought out his notebook, \"about the threats you've been issuing to Timothy, and your hostility towards people of his nationality.\"\n\nAt Winston's words, Rosemary ran a weary hand over her face and sighed. \"Seems word gets around.\"\n\n\"A public event, not long ago. You spoke openly about your, um-\" Winston glanced down at his notes, \"-'distaste' for Chinese folks,\" he pressed on, \"and you've been caught on tape making similar remarks towards Timothy.\"\n\n\"Is that a crime, detective?\" Rosemary challenged.\n\n\"I'm just here to piece the puzzle together. I understand you take a particular interest in Asian culture - antique Asian weapons in particular. I've seen your collection, Rosemary. Sais, even?\" he prodded, hoping for a reaction.\n\nRosemary's gaze sharpened as she turned her back on him, busily cleaning her array of kitchen knives. She didn't confirm nor deny his observation. Noting her silence, Winston thanked her for her time and walked out onto the casino floor, a maelstrom of thoughts whirling around his mind. He felt like he was leaving with more questions than when he had entered.\n\nWinston took a good look at the crime scene, a corner of the bustling casino, cordoned off by the police tape. Something felt grimly out of place among the bright lights and incessant chatter of the casino. He carefully sifted through the conflicting information and people's statements spinning in his head.\n\nTime to get some answers, Winston thought, and made his way to his interviewee.\n\nIt was late in the day when he finally knocked on Harry's door. A man in his early thirties, with a life-hardened face glanced out at him skeptically.\n\n\"Harry, correct?\" Winston asked.\n\n\"And who's asking?\" came the guarded reply.\n\n\"Detective Winston,\" he flashed his badge, \"I'm here to ask you a few questions about Timothy.\"\n\nHarry's eyes flashed, \"I'm not surprised,\" he grumbled. \"Come on in then.\"\n\nAs Winston made his way inside, he noticed the place bore a striking resemblance to traditional dojo settings. A pair of sai swords caught his eye, arranged carefully on a display holder. A typical weapon of the martial arts form Harry used to instruct.\n\n\"Nice collection.\" Winston gestured towards the sai. \"You instruct?\"\n\nHarry looked back at the sai, \"Used to.\"\n\nHarry's manner was gruff, but he seemed at home sharing his old days as a martial arts instructor. They talked about martial arts, how Harry won several competitions, his daily training routine, which apparently included practicing with the sai regularly. Harry's days as a horse trainer surfaced later in the conversation.\n\n\"Got dealt a bad hand?\" Winston inquired casually, nodding at the pile of losing horse race betting slips on Harry's coffee table. \n\nHarry grunted, \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWinston knew Harry only had income from betting on races, and recently he had lost quite a few. Harry had a deep gambling debt with Timothy over his betting habits. Photography was not Winston's hobby, but he recalled Harry's face distinctly in the casino cameras' footage from before the murder took place. There were rumors that Timothy was planning to expose Harry's debt to the other horse owners, and the situation got tough.\n\n\"Got into any recent arguments?\" Winston asked.\n\nHarry frowned and averted his eyes, \"Maybe...just one with Timothy at the casino.”\n\nWinston nodded, keeping his expression neutral. The timing was unfortunate, he thought. And that debt wasn't going anywhere, especially with Harry having recently lost his job at the stables.\n\n\"Heard you were giving out loans?' Winston asked.\n\nHarry's face stiffened, \"He needed money\", he replied, explaining that Timothy had lent him a large sum of money specifically for his betting habit, a haunted expression crossing his face.\n\nWinston stood up, concluding his visit, \"Just one last thing, Harry,\" Winston queried, \"The VIP lounge, in the casino? You're familiar with it, aren't you?\"\n\nHarry met Winston's gaze, resignation in his eyes, \"Used to spend a lot of time there.\"\n\nAs Winston exited the apartment, he couldn't shake off the heavy feeling hanging in the air, leaving him with more questions than answers.

You spoke openly about your, um-\\\" Winston glanced down at his notes, \\\"-'distaste' for Chinese folks,\\\" he pressed on, \\\"and you've been caught on tape making similar remarks towards Timothy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is that a crime, detective?\\\" Rosemary challenged.\\n\\n\\\"I'm just here to piece the puzzle together. I understand you take a particular interest in Asian culture - antique Asian weapons in particular. I've seen your collection, Rosemary. Sais, even?\\\" he prodded, hoping for a reaction.\\n\\nRosemary's gaze sharpened as she turned her back on him, busily cleaning her array of kitchen knives. She didn't confirm nor deny his observation. Noting her silence, Winston thanked her for her time and walked out onto the casino floor, a maelstrom of thoughts whirling around his mind. He felt like he was leaving with more questions than when he had entered.\\n\\nWinston took a good look at the crime scene, a corner of the bustling casino, cordoned off by the police tape. Something felt grimly out of place among the bright lights and incessant chatter of the casino. He carefully sifted through the conflicting information and people's statements spinning in his head.\\n\\nTime to get some answers, Winston thought, and made his way to his interviewee.\\n\\nIt was late in the day when he finally knocked on Harry's door. A man in his early thirties, with a life-hardened face glanced out at him skeptically.\\n\\n\\\"Harry, correct?\\\" Winston asked.\\n\\n\\\"And who's asking?\\\" came the guarded reply.\\n\\n\\\"Detective Winston,\\\" he flashed his badge, \\\"I'm here to ask you a few questions about Timothy.\\\"\\n\\nHarry's eyes flashed, \\\"I'm not surprised,\\\" he grumbled. \\\"Come on in then.\\\"\\n\\nAs Winston made his way inside, he noticed the place bore a striking resemblance to traditional dojo settings. A pair of sai swords caught his eye, arranged carefully on a display holder. A typical weapon of the martial arts form Harry used to instruct.\\n\\n\\\"Nice collection.\\\" Winston gestured towards the sai. \\\"You instruct?\\\"\\n\\nHarry looked back at the sai, \\\"Used to.\\\"\\n\\nHarry's manner was gruff, but he seemed at home sharing his old days as a martial arts instructor. They talked about martial arts, how Harry won several competitions, his daily training routine, which apparently included practicing with the sai regularly. Harry's days as a horse trainer surfaced later in the conversation.\\n\\n\\\"Got dealt a bad hand?\\\" Winston inquired casually, nodding at the pile of losing horse race betting slips on Harry's coffee table. \\n\\nHarry grunted, \\\"Yeah, you could say that.\\\"\\n\\nWinston knew Harry only had income from betting on races, and recently he had lost quite a few. Harry had a deep gambling debt with Timothy over his betting habits. Photography was not Winston's hobby, but he recalled Harry's face distinctly in the casino cameras' footage from before the murder took place. There were rumors that Timothy was planning to expose Harry's debt to the other horse owners, and the situation got tough.\\n\\n\\\"Got into any recent arguments?\\\" Winston asked.\\n\\nHarry frowned and averted his eyes, \\\"Maybe...just one with Timothy at the casino.\\u201d\\n\\nWinston nodded, keeping his expression neutral. The timing was unfortunate, he thought. And that debt wasn't going anywhere, especially with Harry having recently lost his job at the stables.\\n\\n\\\"Heard you were giving out loans?' Winston asked.\\n\\nHarry's face stiffened, \\\"He needed money\\\", he replied, explaining that Timothy had lent him a large sum of money specifically for his betting habit, a haunted expression crossing his face.\\n\\nWinston stood up, concluding his visit, \\\"Just one last thing, Harry,\\\" Winston queried, \\\"The VIP lounge, in the casino? You're familiar with it, aren't you?\\\"\\n\\nHarry met Winston's gaze, resignation in his eyes, \\\"Used to spend a lot of time there.\\\"\\n\\nAs Winston exited the apartment, he couldn't shake off the heavy feeling hanging in the air, leaving him with more questions than answers.

His keen eye caught sight of the security camera footage playing at the front desk – it clearly showed Harry walking into the casino just moments before the tragic murder occurred. He wove his way quickly through the crowd towards his destination – the inner edge of the casino. This secluded corner, often frequented by high rollers, was a crime scene tonight, cordoned off with police tape. Harry, a well-established horse trainer, knew this particular corner all too well.\n\nWinston found Harry standing at the periphery of the scene, alone, seemingly lost in thought. A few onlookers nearby whispered about a heated argument they had witnessed between Harry and Timothy earlier in the night in this very corner.\n\n\"Harry,\" the detective started, as the recognized face turned to meet him, \"Been a while since you've stepped foot in a martial arts tournament, eh?\"\n\nHarry grunted. He wasn't surprised. After all, he was a well-decorated martial arts champion, with several competition victories under his belt. \"In another life, maybe,\" he grumbled. \n\nLiving in the busy business district full of martial arts schools including his own, he had once been a revered martial arts instructor, imparting his knowledge of a specific style – one where the sai was a commonly used weapon – to his students. Daily practice with a sai was part of his routine for years. \n\n\"I heard about your argument with Timothy tonight,\" Winston continued, \"Right here in the corner where our poor victim was found, Harry.\" He gestured towards the cordoned area, then back at Harry. The horse trainer stiffened slightly, but nodded all the same as the reality of questioning sank in. \"I was spotted in the footage, wasn't I?\" he muttered, the deep-seated gambling debt he owed Timothy sketched visible worry lines on his face.\n\n\"As part of our ongoing investigations, we've been checking the security camera footage from the casino,\" Winston explained. \"Interestingly, you're seen entering the place just before the murder.\"\n\nOverhearing their conversation, a staff member chuckled softly before adding, \"He walked in and called John at the front desk, introducing himself as 'Bill'. Then shortly after, he asked Sara, our bartender for a drink, mentioning his name was 'Tom'.

He shrugged and gave them a knowing smile, reminding Winston of the gamble-loving spirit he was dealing with — a spirit that left its fingerprints all over the casino's registration documents. \n\nAs Winston walked away from Harry, he pondered on the debt, the aliases, the martial arts background, and the turning wheel of possibilities in his investigation. Indeed, it was going to be a long night at the casino.\n\nWinston rubbed his temples, grappling with the intricacies of this mystifying case. The victim was Timothy, a man of Chinese heritage, which made the crime scene, a luxurious casino, all the more odd. The murder weapon had been identified as a sai, an exotic Asian weapon.

A visit to the zoo was calming therapy for her bed-ridden brother... at least it usually.\n\nWinston could still envision the terrible scene at the zoo where Daniel had been found lifeless, an eerie death brought on by a medical syringe. Nothing in the vicinity suggested the presence of a murderer except for a couple of eyewitnesses who had spotted Emma around the same time as the murder.\n\nHis last stop was the hospital, where he bumped into Emma finishing her shift. Daniel had been under her care at this very facility. It was clear to Winston that the system trusted her and she held sway in her workplace. \n\nWinston had more questions but he left them for another day. The facts had certainly pointed him to interesting possibilities that had to be pursued diligently. It was a murder that he could sense ran deeper than it appeared.\n\nWinston gingerly stepped into the blurry morning light. His first port of call, the infamous Zoo where Daniel's life was abruptly cut short. As he made his way past the monkey enclosure, a bright red hat peeked out from a treetop. Daniel's hat. No doubt he had been here, but what was he doing in the primate area?\n\nWinston took a step back and scanned the area. His gaze fell upon the makeshift wooden bar tucked away by the corner. That's when he noticed Amelia setting up her bar, placing various liquor bottles in their places, stacking the glasses precisely in her own thirsty manner. Amelia, the bartender from the watering hole Daniel frequented, had begun her day at the zoo early that morning. \n\nSuddenly, the memory of the previous night flashed before Winston's eyes. He remembered seeing Daniel, chatty and jovial as ever at Amelia's bar. This was before the incident, before the silence surrounded by chaos. \n\nWith determined steps, Winston hurried over to Amelia's regular bar in the city. As he walked in, he observed the familiar locale. The cracks in the wall, the faded posters. The painting hanging on the wall of Amelia's home was exactly the same. A violent brawl depicted in the same bar, reflecting Amelia's artistic license in her paintings. A perfect replica of the bar, complete with each minute crack in the wall was stroked with such precision that it sent a shiver down his spine. Amelia, an artist by morning, illustrating the violence that would occur by night.\n\nAll of a sudden, a piercing screech emanated from a nearby enclosure. Winston, startled, quickly turned around and realized it was lunchtime at the zoo. Staff were feeding the animals. Among the staff was Amelia, wielding a small syringe, proficiently sedating an agitated monkey. Winston drew a sharp breath, recalling her proficiency with syringes, the odd weapon of choice in Daniel's murder.\n\nAmelia noticed the detective at nearly the same instant and walked over. Her spunky red hair tied back into a ponytail, her bright green eyes challenging him. Amelia wasn't your typical bartender.  \n\"Brings you quite early today, Winston? Can I get you something to drink?\" Amelia smirked, avoiding any informative conversation. \n\n\"Was Daniel here yesterday?\" Winston probed, ignoring her question. \n\n\"Sure, he got in around the afternoon.\" Amelia paused, glancing at the post-midday sun. \"Anything else you want to?\",\nWinston decided to dig a bit more, \"What time did you close last night, Amelia? Any company?\"\n\n\"Late, as always. I'm alone after hours, you know.\" Amelia shrugged carelessly as she took a small canvas out from behind the bar counter, ready to continue her post-work painting ritual.\n\nAmelia, the artist who moonlighted as a bartender, and a skillful one at that. Winston thought to himself. She defensively guarded her solitary space, applying her painting skills onto canvas after hours, but one whose depictions were less than tranquil.\n\nWith his visit done, Winston tipped his hat off to Amelia and moved on for the day, leaving a nervous bartender in her wake.", "question": "Who is the most likely murderer?", "choices": "['Amelia', 'Emma']", "answer_index": 1, "answer_choice": "Emma"}, "target": "(a)", "arguments": {"gen_args_0": {"arg_0": ["[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please answer the following question with (a), (b), (c), (d) \\n\\nIn the quiet chaos of the city zoo, Detective Winston finds himself investigating an unusual murder, where Daniel, a zookeeper, was fatally injected by a syringe, with only two suspects in sight: Amelia, the grieving widow, and Emma, the secretive co-worker.\\n\\nWinston sat in his chair, sifting through files, his fingertips glossing over the surface of several medical badges.

Serenity, the star wrestler, had publicly threatened her opponent, Terrance. And Terrance, poor lad, was found pale and trembling after their match. Terrance was no stranger to the grit and physicality of ranch life, but the wrestling ring was another story entirely. He had been in the losing end of a previous matchup with Serenity. \n\nFinally placated by the caffeine and recalling his purpose, Winston trudged to the boots and scruff leather of the local ranch. He was greeted by the sight of Terrance coordinating his ranch work, his sun-worn skin a testament to long hours under the warm Texan sun. \"You're Terrance I suppose?\" Winston asked, as he gestured to the flourishing land around them.\n\n\"That'd be me, Detective,\" Terrance replied in a thick southern drawl. \"This land's been around longer than I have. Been a rancher all my life.\"\n\nThere was an odd sense of hitched anxiety when Winston brought up the chainsaw classes he'd heard Terrance attended. \"Gotta know how to operatin' it,\" Terrance replied. \"Helps keepin' the place run smooth.\"\n\nWinston hustled over to where the recent wrestling match had taken place. It was a local tradition in the town and Terrance was no stranger to it, being a regular sponsor. It was a sweltering evening when he found himself at the scene, their wrestling ring splattered with the remnants of what occurred.\n\nReturning to the station under the glow of disjointed neon lights, Winston on a hunch asked a few local attendees about the particular wrestling match where Serenity was killed. Terrance was in the crowd that night, cheering heatedly during the match.\n\nIn a more relaxed visit to the local bar, Terrance appeared more forthright. \"She was strong, Detective. Really strong,\" Terrance eased into his confession after a few sips of his drink. At another instance, in a low murmured admission to some friends, Terrance had been heard saying he felt threatened by Serenity. There were rumors around of Terrance being seen frequently repairing a chainsaw. The very same chainsaw Terrance learned to operate, and the chilling instrument that ended Serenity's life.\n\nFor now, this was the puzzle Winston had to unravel. He gave Terrance a long, discerning look over the rim of his beer glass before leaving the lightly crowded bar. On his way out, the words of a recent reports echoed in his head, “A chainsaw is essential in ranch work…”\n\nWinston had been downing cups of coffee all day, trying to make sense of the pieces of what seemed like a nonsensical puzzle. He made a decision to visit the place it all transpired – an old, grimy wrestling ring where Serenity had met her horrific end.\n\nThe image of the chainsaw used as the murder weapon kept coming back to him. So brutal was it that Winston found it hard to shake off. He had heard that Nelson, the painter and prime suspect in the case, had been seen training with a chainsaw - a tool that he directly employed in his painting procedures, forming part of his job. The oddity seemed to strengthen the potential motive Nelson had for this grim act and Winston felt compelled to pursue this lead.\n\nAfter a quick tour to the local gallery, Winston visited an exhibition where Nelson's pieces were showcased. It was evident that his chainsaw artwork had amassed some level of local attention, owing to their exceptional detailing accomplished with a chainsaw. Nelson adored wood, especially intricate shapes created out of it. He would often proclaim that shaping wood using his chainsaw was an integral part of his painting role. His proficiency seemed uncanny, almost eerie, but the public admired his work for its notable woodsiness.\n\nFrom the gallery, Winston travelled to the correction facility where Nelson used to work. The officers seemed reluctant to speak about the past events which led to Nelson's termination and the painter's complete obliteration from the collective memory. Winston found no records of Nelson in the personnel files. His data seemed to have been deliberately wiped out, prompting Winston to question their collective avoidance in discussing Nelson.\n\nWinston then moved to his final stop, Nelson's quaint bungalow. Unusually quiet and still with the curtains tightly drawn; not the usual sight, as reported by neighbors who mentioned Nelson's affection for painting under natural light. Winston learned that Nelson had ceased attending the weekly game nights at the local pub, coinciding with his new preference for drawn curtains.\n\nAs Winston introspected leaning against his car, he realized the significance of the patterns in the changing behaviors of the painter. Winston was now confident that Nelson indeed had a strong motive in Serenity's demise – albeit, this was supported by an eerie amalgamation of evidence: the drawn curtains, the nonattendance at the pub, the wiped data, the unusual termination, and finally, his habitual, ominous use of chainsaws. \n\nTime was ticking away, and Winston was now more determined than ever. He drove away from Nelson’s bungalow, deep in thoughts about the painter and his last works that haunted his thoughts.
